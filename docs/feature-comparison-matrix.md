# OpenSpec IDE Extension — Feature Comparison Matrix

A comprehensive comparison of the OpenSpec IntelliJ plugin against known VS Code extensions.

> **Maintenance: Snapshot** — reviewed per release, not per-change. This plugin's own row is kept current; the VS Code extension data (versions, install counts, features) is a point-in-time competitive survey and may lag reality. **Last reviewed: 2026-08-02** (plugin v0.6.0). For the version-by-version support matrix (what the plugin covers vs. the OpenSpec client), see [OpenSpec Client Coverage](openspec-support.md) instead.

## Unique Features Per Extension

### IntelliJ Plugin (This Plugin)
- Full IDE-native experience (inspections, annotations, line markers, tool window)
- Master/detail spec-and-change viewer: a rendered-markdown preview pane beside the tree, with content-aware search over requirement and scenario text
- Consolidated change-deltas view — everything a change modifies at the spec level, grouped by capability/operation and badged, assembled from the CLI, cross-linked to the per-capability delta diff
- Artifact-status badge overlays on tree node icons (done / ready / blocked / not-created) with X/Y task-progress on change nodes
- Grouped, navigable validation console (by file, clickable file:line links, per-severity color) plus a Project-View context-menu Validate scoped to the clicked change or spec
- Multi-provider Direct API generation with secure credential storage (Claude, OpenAI, Gemini)
- Visual artifact pipeline with DAG-driven workflow
- Scaffolding detection preventing false "complete" status
- AI tool detection with type-aware guidance (CLI vs IDE panel)
- Built-in + CLI-enhanced validation with inline results
- Works fully offline without CLI (built-in fallback mode)
- Fast-Forward: one-click change creation + full artifact generation
- Spec sync: merge delta specs into main specs with preview dialog
- Bulk archive with conflict detection for multi-change projects
- Explore panel: assembled project context for AI conversations
- Custom schema management: fork, create, and switch workflow schemas
- Config profile display and workflow management
- Verify action: completeness and task-progress checking with report dialog
- Coordination tab tracking the OpenSpec client's evolving multi-repo model — 1.4 workspaces/context-stores/initiatives and the 1.5 store/workset model — with a read-only listing plus create/manage actions, version-gated to the detected CLI

### Codder13 (VS Code)
- CodeLens integration on `tasks.md` — click a task to open Copilot Chat with full project context injected
- Tight coupling with GitHub Copilot Chat (sends prompt + context automatically)
- Proposed for official OpenSpec adoption (GitHub issue #309)

### atman-dev (VS Code)
- Copilot Chat Participant — registers as @-mentionable in Copilot Chat, can write directly into the chat window
- GitHub Copilot prompt management (`.github/prompts/` generation)
- GitHub issue creation from changes
- Design generation workflow

### AngDrew (VS Code)
- Ralph Loop batch processing (automated artifact generation cycles)
- Live monitoring via localhost:4099
- Tied to OpenCode agentic CLI

### AvantMedia (VS Code)
- Real-time progress badge notifications
- Minimal, focused change/task monitoring panel

## Gap Analysis: What Others Have That We Don't (Yet)

| Feature | Who Has It | Priority | Planned |
|---|---|---|---|
| CodeLens on tasks (click to start AI chat) | Codder13 | High | No — no equivalent on task lines |
| Chat Participant API (write into Copilot Chat) | Codder13, atman-dev | Medium | No IntelliJ equivalent API |
| Auto-inject project context into AI chat | Codder13 | Medium | Investigate |
| GitHub issue creation from changes | atman-dev | Low | — |
| Batch processing loops (Ralph Loop) | AngDrew | Medium | Have "Generate All" |
| Live monitoring server | AngDrew | Low | — |
| Badge notifications | AvantMedia | Low | Have inline status |

**Key gaps**: Codder13's CodeLens + Copilot Chat injection and the Chat Participant API (used by both Codder13 and atman-dev) are the most compelling features missing from our plugin. The Chat Participant API is a VS Code-specific capability — extensions register as @-mentionable participants that can write directly into the Copilot Chat window. IntelliJ has no equivalent public API for Copilot's chat panel. The IntelliJ equivalent for CodeLens would be gutter icons on task lines that trigger AI chat with context, aligning with the "Spec Intelligence" direction in v0.2.0. For chat integration, our Direct API approach serves as the alternative strategy.

## Platform Advantages: IntelliJ vs VS Code

| Capability | IntelliJ Advantage | VS Code Equivalent |
|---|---|---|
| Inspections framework | Deep, configurable, per-scope analysis | Basic diagnostics |
| Quick-fixes (LocalQuickFix) | Context-aware, undo-able, batched | Code Actions (simpler) |
| Line markers / gutter icons | Rich, clickable, layered | Limited (decorations) |
| Editor annotations | Inline, severity-based | Decorations (text only) |
| Tool window framework | Dockable, resizable, tabbed, persistent | Webview panels |
| Settings framework | Searchable, grouped, validated | Settings JSON |
| PSI / code analysis | Full AST, cross-reference, refactoring | Language Server (external) |
| Credential storage | OS keychain via PasswordSafe | Secrets API (simpler) |
| File watchers | VFS-level, reliable, batched | fs.watch (less reliable) |
| Progress indicators | Modal/background, cancellable, nested | Limited |
| Chat Participant API | No equivalent — no public API for Copilot Chat | Extensions can register as @-mentionable chat participants |

IntelliJ's platform gives us capabilities that VS Code extensions fundamentally cannot match in depth. However, VS Code's Chat Participant API is a notable counter-advantage — it lets extensions write directly into Copilot Chat, which IntelliJ cannot replicate. The strategy should be to lean into IntelliJ's platform advantages (inspections, gutter icons, tool windows) and our Direct API approach as the alternative to chat participant integration.
