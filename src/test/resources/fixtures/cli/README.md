# CLI contract fixtures — provenance manifest

Every file here is **real output captured from the OpenSpec CLI** (never hand-authored), per
the project's contract-test discipline: captures run under an isolated environment
(`HOME`/`XDG_DATA_HOME`/`XDG_CONFIG_HOME`/`XDG_STATE_HOME` pointed at fresh temp dirs,
telemetry off) and machine-specific absolute paths are sanitized to the `/fixture/...`
convention before commit.

## Layout rules

- **Version-named directories** (`1.5.0/`, `1.6.0/`, …) hold captures whose CLI generation is
  known exactly. All **new** captures go into the directory matching the capturing CLI version.
- **The versionless root is frozen.** Its files are legacy-generation captures with mixed
  provenance (recorded below). They are retained verbatim as parse coverage for the CLI
  generations the plugin still supports, and are never moved, re-pointed, or re-captured in
  place. A root file may be deleted only when the plugin drops support for its generation
  (a spec-level change).
- **Pinned fixtures** are captures of commands that no longer exist in the current CLI. They
  can never be refreshed and remain the only coverage for the generation that provided the
  command. Their consuming tests carry the same note.

## Root (frozen legacy captures)

| File | Capturing CLI | Recapturable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `status.json` | ≈1.3 era (committed 2026-03-07) | yes — 1.6.0 twin exists | Verify completeness-gate contract |
| `status-with-context.json` | 1.5.0 (committed 2026-07-04) | yes — 1.6.0 twin exists | `actionContext` + `missingDeps` shape |
| `instructions-{proposal,specs,tasks}.json` | ≈1.3 era (committed 2026-03-07) | yes — 1.6.0 twins exist | staged artifact-DAG states |
| `validate.json` | ≈1.3 era (committed 2026-03-07) | yes — 1.6.0 twin exists | mixed valid/invalid items |
| `schema-validate-{clean,broken,missing-template}.json` | 1.4.1 | yes — 1.6.0 twins exist | per `SchemaToolingContractTest` javadoc |
| `schema-which-{builtin,project,shadowing}.json` | 1.4.1 | yes — 1.6.0 twins exist | |
| `templates-builtin.json` | 1.4.1 | yes — 1.6.0 twin exists | |
| `update-{clean,legacy-pending,legacy-pending-regenerated}.txt` | 1.4.1 (noted byte-identical on 1.5.0) | yes — 1.6.0 twins exist | legacy project initialized by CLI 1.3.1 |
| `coordination-{workspace-list,initiative-list,context-store-list,context-store-doctor}.json` | 1.4.x | **NO — PINNED** | `workspace`/`context-store`/`initiative` commands were removed upstream at 1.5.0; these are the only parse coverage for the still-supported 1.4.x line |

## `1.3.0/` — floor-version parity guard

Captured from CLI **1.3.0** (the plugin's supported floor) by the `builtin-validator-cli-parity`
change. `validate.json` is a real `validate --all --json` over a two-spec corpus — one valid spec
whose only issue is a WARNING (`good`, `valid:true`) and one requirement-missing-`SHALL` spec
(`bad`, `valid:false`, one ERROR + one WARNING). It exists to lock in the cross-version stability of
the `validate --json` shape the CLI-authoritative merge depends on: the item's `valid` field,
`issues[].level/message`, `type`, and `id` are byte-identical across 1.3.0 → 1.6.0 (only a top-level
`root` key was added in 1.5, which the parser ignores). Consumed by
`CliContractTest.FloorVersionValidateContractV13`, which asserts the parser derives the per-item
verdict from `valid` on this older, `root`-less shape. Re-capture from a real 1.3.x CLI if the floor
shape ever changes.

## `1.5.0/` — store/workset generation set

Captured from CLI 1.5.0 (store/workset surface work; `stores-registry.yaml`/`worksets.yaml`
are on-disk state files, the rest is command output). Retained as 1.5-generation coverage:
1.5 register refuses a fresh/config-only root (`store_register_root_unhealthy`), which 1.6
no longer does. See `StoreWorksetContractTest`/`StoreWorksetWriteContractTest` javadoc for
per-file recipes. `store-list-native-paths.json` is a real Windows capture
(cross-platform-verification); unrecapturable without a Windows host but the command still
exists — re-capture on Windows if refreshed.

## `1.6.0/` — current-generation set

Captured from CLI 1.6.0. Store family (5 files) captured by the store-health change; the
rest by the fixture-sweep change. Recipes live in the capturing change's `design.md`
(archived under `openspec/changes/archive/`) and the consuming tests' javadoc. Highlights
of what this generation changed:

- `validate --all --json`: new top-level `root`/`summary`/`version` keys; missing-SHALL issue
  path is `requirements[0]` with reworded message; new INFO-level issue (with a `line` field)
  for non-canonical level-3 headers inside change deltas, emitted on `valid: true` items.
- `validate-single-{spec,change,change-invalid}.json` — real single-item
  `openspec validate <id> --type spec|change --json` (the Project-View scoped Validate's CLI call).
  The single-item envelope carries the same `items[]` element shape as `--all` but a one-element
  array plus top-level `summary`/`version`/`root`; `parseJsonOutput` handles it unchanged.
  `-spec` is a valid spec whose only issue is a WARNING (skipped on a `valid:true` item);
  `-change` is a clean change (no issues); `-change-invalid` is a delta-less change (one ERROR).
  Consumed by `CliContractTest.SingleItemValidateContractV16`. `root.path` sanitized to `/fixture`.
  Re-capture (per CLI generation): under an isolated `HOME`/`XDG_*` env, `openspec init`, author a
  spec under `openspec/specs/<cap>/spec.md`, a valid change and a delta-less change under
  `openspec/changes/`, then run `validate <id> --type spec|change --json` and `sed` the root path.
- `status --json` / `instructions --json`: additive `planningHome`/`changeRoot`/
  `artifactPaths`/`nextSteps` keys; existing keys unchanged.
- `update`: legacy-migration block unchanged but gains a `Migrated: custom profile ...`
  preamble and profile-note trailers. At 1.6.0, `init --tools junie` still creates legacy
  `.junie/commands/` files that `update` immediately flags (captured as-is); `--force`
  regenerates them without adding `opsx-sync.md` (the migrated "custom profile" preserves
  the old workflow set). The `update-clean.txt` capture uses `--tools claude` (skills-only
  delivery, no migration block).
- `validate-parity-corpus.json` + `parity-corpus/` — verdict-parity pair: the corpus
  (committed markdown, exercising keyword/fence/scenario/skipped-header rule classes) is
  materialized into a test project and judged by the plugin's built-in validator, while the
  fixture is the real 1.6.0 CLI's `validate --all --json` over the same corpus (isolated
  env, minimal proposals present so both sides see identical content). Re-capture: re-run
  `validate --all --json` over `parity-corpus/` seeded into a fresh `openspec init` project.
  See `ValidatorVerdictParityTest`. The `align-spec-parser-with-cli` change grew the corpus
  with five adversarial specs (`indented-code`, `setext-header`, `table-keyword`,
  `html-comment-req`, `nested-list-scenario`) — each a valid spec plus a structural distractor
  (an indented/fenced/tabulated/commented/setext marker the CLI does not treat as structure) —
  so the corpus is now 13 items (11 specs + 2 changes).
- `spec-structure/<id>.show.json` — structure-parity captures: the real 1.6.0 CLI's
  `openspec show <id> --json --type spec` for every spec in `parity-corpus/openspec/specs/`,
  one file per spec. `SpecParserCliStructureContractTest` asserts the plugin's
  `SpecParsingService` recovers the same `requirementCount` and per-requirement scenario count.
  `root.path` is the only sanitized field (→ `/fixture`); note the CLI's `title` field is the
  spec **id**, not the markdown H1. Re-capture (per CLI generation): seed `parity-corpus`'s
  specs into a fresh `openspec init --tools claude` project under an isolated
  `HOME`/`XDG_*` env, run `show` per spec id, and `sed` the project root path to `/fixture`.
- Store family: fresh/config-only roots register successfully and doctor reports
  `healthy: true` with per-directory `present: false`; new refusal codes
  `invalid_store_pointer`, `store_root_pointer_declared`; new
  `store_register_identity_confirmation_required` envelope.
- `change-deltas/{mixed,rename-only,empty}.show.json` — the real 1.6.0 CLI's
  `openspec show <change> --type change --json` (stdout only; the command also prints a
  spurious `Warning: Ignoring flags not applicable to change: scenarios` to stderr on
  success, which is discarded). Consumed by `ChangeDeltasContractTest`. `mixed` spans two
  capabilities (`auth`, `billing`) with all four operations — ADDED+MODIFIED under `auth`,
  REMOVED+RENAMED under `billing` (`deltaCount: 4`); `rename-only` isolates the
  requirement-less RENAMED branch; `empty` is `deltaCount: 0`. Verified shape: every
  non-RENAMED delta carries BOTH a singular `requirement{text,scenarios[].rawText}` and a
  one-element `requirements[]` mirror (so `requirement == requirements[0]`); REMOVED carries
  `requirement.text` with `scenarios: []`; only RENAMED is requirement-less (`rename{from,to}`).
  Re-capture (per CLI generation): under an isolated `HOME`/`XDG_*` env, `openspec init`, seed
  main specs for the MODIFY/REMOVE/RENAME targets under `openspec/specs/<cap>/spec.md`, author a
  change with the four delta operations across two capabilities, then run `show` per change id
  and `sed` the project root path to `/fixture` (`root.path` is the only sanitized field).
