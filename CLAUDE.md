# intellij-openspec — agent conventions

Project-specific rules for AI agents working in this repo.

## Tracker mirroring — invoke the custom skills, never inline curl

OpenSpec changes are mirrored to project trackers via project-level custom skills. The three lifecycle skills keep the Plane card flowing **Todo → In Progress → Done** in step with the change, so it stays legible in Kanban/cycle/board views at every stage:

| When | Skill | Plane state |
|---|---|---|
| After `openspec-propose` or `openspec-new-change` | `/mirror-change-trackers <name>` | → Todo |
| At the start of `openspec-apply-change` (implementation begins) | `/advance-change-trackers <name>` | → In Progress |
| After `openspec-archive-change` | `/close-change-trackers <archive-dir>` | → Done |

Without the middle step the card jumps Todo→Done and never appears in the "In Progress" column while work is actually happening. Forgejo issues have no In-Progress state (open/closed only), so `advance-change-trackers` touches Plane only and leaves the issue open.

**Why these skills are custom-named, not inside `openspec-*`:** the `openspec` CLI manages `.claude/skills/openspec-*/SKILL.md` and rewrites them on every `openspec update`. Custom-named skills (`mirror-change-trackers`, `advance-change-trackers`, `close-change-trackers`, `release-cut`, `release-prep`) live outside that managed surface and survive updates.

**These five skills are gitignored** (`.gitignore` entries `.claude/skills/{mirror,advance,close}-change-trackers/`, `.claude/skills/release-cut/`, and `.claude/skills/release-prep/`). They intrinsically reference `forgejo.geek`, the Plane project UUID, `mcp__homelab__*` server-tool names, and `johnb/intellij-openspec` — things that violate the anti-leak rule below if they reach the public GitHub mirror. The skill files exist on disk and work in any local session; they just don't ride to git history. Edits to these skills are local-only.

**Do not put tracker plumbing back into the `openspec-*` skills.** If you find yourself tempted, you're at the wrong layer.

**Do not commit these skills back into tracked state.** If you need a tracked skill that does similar work, write a vendor-neutral one that takes config from environment / a separate file rather than hardcoding the homelab references.

## Tracker IDs go in a gitignored `.tracking.yaml` sidecar

Inside each change directory (`openspec/changes/<name>/`, and the archived form), tracker IDs live in a `.tracking.yaml` file. The file is gitignored so it never enters version control. `mirror-change-trackers` writes it; `close-change-trackers` reads it.

**Do not put tracker IDs in `proposal.md`, `design.md`, or `tasks.md`** — those files are published when the change archives.
**Do not put them in `.openspec.yaml`** — its upstream Zod schema recognizes only a fixed change-metadata field set (`schema:`, `created:`, and on CLI ≥1.6 the optional `goal:`/`affected_areas:`/`initiative:`) and **silently strips every unknown key**, so tracker IDs written there just vanish. The load-bearing reason is the strip, not the exact field list — the sidecar rule stands regardless of which descriptive fields upstream adds.
**Do not put them in commit messages** — `git log` is public on GitHub.

The broader rule: nothing local-homelab-specific ever lands in artifacts that will reach GitHub. That includes Forgejo URLs (`forgejo.geek`, `johnb/intellij-openspec#N`), Plane identifiers (`OSP-N`, `OSPEC-N`), `*.geek` hostnames, homelab MCP server names (`mcp__homelab__*`), and the `johnb` username. Use vendor-neutral wording — "tracker entry", "the linked issue" — in any published surface (proposal/design/tasks/CHANGELOG/README/docs/code comments/commit messages). Before any commit, grep the staged files: `grep -nrE "forgejo|plane|geek|OSPEC|OSP-|johnb/" <staged>`.

> **Provenance note:** the storage convention here (sidecar over proposal.md) is project-local. The upstream OpenSpec CLI doesn't mandate a tracker convention — its proposal template defines `Why → What Changes → Capabilities → Impact` and is silent on tracker IDs entirely. 10 archived proposals from 2026-04-29 onward still carry inline `## References` lines as a vestige of the prior local convention; new proposals use the sidecar.

## If `openspec update` clobbers customizations

```bash
git checkout HEAD -- .claude/skills/
```

Since the 1.5.0 skills-only migration, `.claude/skills/openspec-*/` is the only *tracked* surface the CLI regenerates. The other AI-tool skill mirrors (`.augment/`, `.codex/`, `.gemini/`, `.github/skills/`, `.junie/`) are gitignored regenerated copies — clobbering there is harmless, and git can't (and needn't) restore them. The custom-named skills are gitignored too, so the checkout won't touch them.

## Plugin-internal config fields — audit before "aligning" to upstream

When you're tempted to remove a field from `openspec/config.yaml`, `plugin.xml`, `.openspec.yaml`, or any other config file because "upstream's schema doesn't accept it / strips it / doesn't mention it", **stop and grep this codebase for reads of that field first**. We are a *wrapper around upstream OpenSpec*; both the upstream contract and the plugin's own internal contract are load-bearing.

Concrete known case (incident 2026-06-15, commit `c34c7b2`): `version:` in `openspec/config.yaml` is not defined by upstream's Zod schema (`@fission-ai/openspec`'s `project-config.ts`) and is ignored by it, but the plugin reads it. **At the time of the incident** the plugin also *required* it — `BuiltInValidator.validateConfig` emitted `config-version-required` WARNING + `config-field-required` ERROR when it was missing — so removing it broke the plugin's self-validation for ~24 hours until restored. **Current status (relaxed by `align-config-contract-with-cli`):** the field is now **read-only-fallback, not required**. `config-version-required` no longer exists as a rule, `config-field-required` covers `schema` only, and absence resolves to `VersionSupport.V1_2` with zero validation issues. `OpenSpecSettings.getEffectiveVersion` still reads it as the config-format-axis fallback when no Settings override is set, but its *value* is currently inert because `VersionSupport` has a single baseline (V1_2). It is retained as the extension seam for a future config-format bump, per the deliberate axis-pin decision — do not delete the axis to "simplify". **Retirement (config-scaffold-hygiene):** the plugin no longer *writes* `version:` (or the plugin-invented `profile:`) into a scaffolded `config.yaml` — that shape now matches upstream `openspec init` (schema-only). But the *readers* stay: `getEffectiveVersion`'s fallback and the tree-view/`SpecTreeModel` nodes still read `version:`/`profile:` from a legacy config that has them. So the lesson sharpens rather than expires: even after you stop *writing* a plugin-internal field, grep before removing the *reader* — a legacy config on disk may still carry it. The field was load-bearing when the incident happened, is now read-only-legacy, and grepping first is what tells you which.

The general rule:
- Before deleting a key in any project config file, run `grep -rn "<key>" src/main/java/ src/test/java/`. If there are hits, the key is plugin-internal — keep it, even if upstream doesn't acknowledge it.
- If a field is genuinely plugin-internal-only, leave an inline comment on the field explaining why upstream doesn't see it.
- If you find an internal/upstream divergence that's load-bearing on both sides, surface it before changing — it's a candidate for either a plugin-side refactor (decouple from the upstream field) or upstream issue, not a quiet config edit.

## Branching & pull requests — develop on `origin`, mirror to GitHub

Default workflow (adopted 2026-06-27): non-trivial work goes through a **pull request on the Forgejo `origin` remote**, not a direct push to `main`.

- Branch from `main` → push the branch to `origin` → open a PR on `origin` → let CI run → self-merge → then mirror with `git push github main`.
- **GitHub is a read-only mirror** of `main`. Review/PRs live on `origin`. GitHub's classic branch protection no longer requires PRs (removed 2026-06-27 — you can't PR a mirror) but still blocks force-push and deletion of public `main`.
- The `pre-push` leak guard (`.githooks/pre-push`, activated via `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`) vets every push to the GitHub mirror. Never weaken its pattern back to `\b` — git grep ignores it.
- **Trivial changes** (doc/tracker/comment tweaks) may still go direct to `main` on `origin` — use judgement.
- After a PR merges, delete the branch locally (`git branch -d`) and on `origin` (`git push origin --delete <name>`), per the standing workflow preference.

## Testing — required, and tests must verify *real* behavior

OpenSpec's `tasks` rules already mandate tests for every change and that *"each test SHALL fail if the code it covers is broken."* Enforcement layers on top of that:

- **CI gate:** `./gradlew build` runs the suite plus a JaCoCo coverage **regression floor** (`jacocoTestCoverageVerification`, wired into `check`). A PR can't merge red. The floor is a backstop against backsliding — ratchet the minimums in `build.gradle.kts` upward as coverage grows; it is *not* a substitute for covering new code.
- **Local pre-push gate:** `.githooks/pre-push` runs `./gradlew test` when pushed commits touch `src/` (every remote except the post-merge GitHub mirror). Activate per clone with `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`. Emergency bypass: `git push --no-verify`.
- **Plugin Verifier pre-push gate (platform-API changes):** the same hook also runs `./gradlew verifyPlugin` when a push adds/changes a `com.intellij.*` reference in Java. This is load-bearing because `./gradlew build`/`test` compile against the build SDK and **cannot** catch API incompatibilities against the target IDEs — only the verifier can. A verify-only CI failure (an unresolved `PlatformProjectOpenProcessor.attachToProject(...)` that compiled locally but would `NoSuchMethodError` on 2024.2) is why this exists: catch it locally (~3–5 min once the IDE archives are cached) instead of on the slow CI verify job. Skip this gate alone with `SKIP_VERIFY_PLUGIN=1 git push`.

**Contract-test external output — don't hand-write the expected shape.** Any code that parses output from an external tool (the OpenSpec CLI's `--json`, file/registry formats on disk, an API response) MUST be tested against **captured real output**, not a hand-authored approximation of what you *think* the shape is. Hand-written fixtures encode your assumption, so the test passes while the parser is wrong — a green-but-vacuous test.

- Capture once from the real tool (for CLI state that needs setup, use an isolated `XDG_DATA_HOME` so the real global dir is untouched), **sanitize machine-specific paths**, and commit under `src/test/resources/fixtures/cli/`.
- Add a contract test that parses the fixture (see `CliContractTest` and `CoordinationContractTest`). When the tool's output format changes, re-capture the fixture and fix the failures.
- Incident that motivated this: the Phase 3 coordination parsers were unit-tested against inferred JSON and shipped three shape bugs (wrong artifact nesting, wrong doctor key, wrong fallback dir) that all passed CI. Contract-testing against the real CLI caught them immediately.

## Agent routing — consult the project subagents at their trigger points

Project subagents live in `.claude/agents/`. Their descriptions state when to invoke them; the failure mode to avoid is doing the work inline when a designated agent exists for it. Standing trigger points:

- **test-engineer** — PLAN mode at the *start* of implementing every OpenSpec change (fixture strategy, what only verifyPlugin/uiSmoke can catch); AUDIT mode alongside code review whenever a diff touches parsers of external output or adds tests with inline expected-shape literals.
- **openspec-guru** — before any design decision that turns on what upstream OpenSpec models or emits (CLI shapes, config schemas, lifecycle procedure). Rule of thumb: if the proposal would introduce a concept, verify upstream has it first.
- **jetbrains-platform-guru** — before implementing anything that touches new IntelliJ Platform APIs or extension points (feasibility on 2024.2+, threading/dumb-mode implications).
- **plugin-ui-specialist** — when a feature needs a UI home ("which surface tells the story") or a demo/walkthrough is being planned.
- **intellij-code-reviewer** — after the generic review, for any diff touching PSI/VFS/EDT/services/actions/inspections.
- A gitignored, clone-local **project-management agent** may also exist (untracked — it references private infrastructure). When present: run its tracker/board **audit** after closing an epic item and before any release cut (`/release-prep` step 0 invokes it). Per-change tracker mechanics stay with the lifecycle skills, not the agent.

## Release & publishing

**Release-state preflight — do this BEFORE proposing any release step or version number.** Never infer release state from memory, a memory-index hook, or the resting `version = "..."` in `build.gradle.kts` — that value is the *last shipped* release, not the next one. Derive it from git and the changelog every time:

```bash
git tag -l 'v*' | sort -V | tail -1          # last SHIPPED version
git rev-list "$(git tag -l 'v*' | sort -V | tail -1)"..HEAD --count   # commits since (0 ⇒ nothing to release)
awk '/^## Unreleased/{f=1;next} /^## v/{f=0} f' CHANGELOG.md | grep -c '\S'   # Unreleased non-empty?
```

If HEAD is at the last tag and `## Unreleased` is empty, there is nothing to cut — say so. Otherwise the next version is the user's semver choice **strictly greater than the last tag** (the minor-vs-patch call is theirs, never inferred). If the last tag already equals the version you were about to prep, STOP — that release shipped; the pending work is the *next* one.

**Doc-fidelity is a precondition, not a mid-cut afterthought.** Before *suggesting* the release process, run the doc-fidelity gate over the user-facing surfaces (`docs/marketplace-page.md`, `docs/feature-comparison-matrix.md`, `docs/feature-reference.md`) against the `## Unreleased` feature set, and land any refresh as its own doc commit. (`/release-cut` also gates on this at step 3, but surfacing stale user-facing docs *before* the cut is proposed avoids a late scramble — this is why the v0.5.0 pass was nearly skipped.)

- Never run `publishPlugin` locally. CI handles signing and JetBrains Marketplace publishing on `v*` tag push.
- Use `/release-cut <version>` to start a release — it bumps `build.gradle.kts`, rolls `## Unreleased` into a versioned changelog section (`./gradlew patchChangelog`), and opens the release PR.
- Use `/release-prep <version>` before tagging — it validates `build.gradle.kts`, `CHANGELOG.md`, build, archived changes, and tracker state.
- `CHANGELOG.md` is for plugin users only — no internal housekeeping, tracker triage, or personal workflow notes.
