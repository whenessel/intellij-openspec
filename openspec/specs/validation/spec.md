# Validation

## Purpose
Built-in validation of OpenSpec project structure, spec format, config integrity, delta spec correctness, and artifact completeness — with real-time IDE inspections and file watching.
## Requirements
### Requirement: CLI verdict is authoritative when the CLI is available

When the OpenSpec CLI is available and a `validate` run completes successfully with parseable output, the plugin SHALL treat the CLI's result as authoritative for the artifacts the CLI validates — specs and change deltas — rather than overriding it with the built-in validator's own opinion. The plugin SHALL derive each CLI-validated item's pass/fail from that item's `valid` field in the CLI output (mirroring the client's own rule `valid = strictMode ? errors===0 && warnings===0 : errors===0`), not by re-deriving pass/fail from the severities of the issues the plugin extracted. The built-in validator SHALL NOT contribute spec or change issues that fail the merged verdict when the CLI has produced a verdict for those artifacts.

Because the CLI's `validate` never reads `openspec/config.yaml`, the built-in validator SHALL remain the sole owner of `config.yaml` validation in all paths. For a whole-project validation with the CLI available, the merged verdict SHALL be `cli.passed() && builtInConfig.passed()`, where `builtInConfig` is the built-in validator scoped to `config.yaml`, and the displayed issues SHALL be the union of the CLI's spec/change issues and the built-in's config issues. For a single-spec or single-change target with the CLI available, the verdict SHALL be the CLI's alone (no config component). When the CLI is unavailable, or its run fails or emits unparseable output, the plugin SHALL fall back to the full built-in validator as the verdict — never to a blind pass.

#### Scenario: Clean CLI is not overridden by the built-in validator
- **WHEN** the CLI is available and reports the project's specs/changes `valid`, but the built-in validator's own spec/change rules would have flagged an ERROR for one of them (any residual stricter-than-CLI rule)
- **THEN** the plugin's whole-project verdict SHALL NOT fail on account of that built-in spec/change ERROR — the CLI verdict is authoritative for specs/changes and the built-in validator's spec/change rules do not contribute to the verdict when the CLI covered them

#### Scenario: Whole-project verdict combines CLI specs/changes with built-in config
- **WHEN** a whole-project validation runs with the CLI available
- **THEN** the merged verdict SHALL be `cli.passed() && builtInConfig.passed()`, and the reported issues SHALL be the union of the CLI's spec/change issues and the built-in validator's `config.yaml` issues

#### Scenario: Config warnings surface but do not fail a clean-CLI verdict
- **WHEN** the CLI reports all specs/changes valid and `openspec/config.yaml` is missing its `schema:` field
- **THEN** the built-in `config-schema-required` WARNING SHALL be surfaced for display alongside the CLI's verdict, and the merged whole-project verdict SHALL pass — config checks are non-failing, so the built-in validator never reds a project the CLI reports clean

#### Scenario: Single-item verdict defers entirely to the CLI
- **WHEN** a single spec or change is validated with the CLI available
- **THEN** the verdict SHALL be the CLI's `valid` result for that item, with no config component merged in

#### Scenario: Failed or unparseable CLI run falls back to the built-in validator
- **WHEN** the CLI is available but the `validate` run throws, exits abnormally, or emits output that is not parseable
- **THEN** the plugin SHALL use the full built-in validator's result as the verdict, not a blind pass

#### Scenario: Verdict parity against captured CLI output
- **WHEN** the captured real 1.6.0 CLI `--json` fixture is parsed
- **THEN** the plugin's per-item pass/fail SHALL equal each item's `valid` field for every item in the fixture

### Requirement: Config validation

The plugin SHALL validate `openspec/config.yaml` for structural correctness when the file exists, applying only the rules that mirror upstream OpenSpec's own contract. The built-in validator SHALL own `config.yaml` validation in all paths — including when the CLI is present, since the CLI's `validate` never reads `config.yaml`. That ownership is **display-only and non-failing**: config validation SHALL NOT emit any ERROR-severity issue and SHALL NEVER fail a validation verdict, because `openspec validate` never fails on any `config.yaml` state (verified against the real CLI — a missing, empty, or unrecognized `schema`, and even malformed YAML, all validate clean, since upstream tolerates a missing schema and defaults to `spec-driven`). The file itself SHALL be optional — matching upstream's `readProjectConfig() → null // No config is OK` semantics — so a project initialized with `openspec init` and never customized SHALL produce zero config-related validation issues. When the file does exist, validation SHALL enforce only the fields upstream defines in its Zod `ProjectConfigSchema` (`schema`, `context`, `rules`); fields the plugin reads as internal-only extensions (`version`, `profile`) SHALL NOT fire issues when absent. A missing or empty `schema` field SHALL raise a single WARNING (rule `config-schema-required`) — a hygiene nudge that OpenSpec defaults to `spec-driven` — and SHALL NOT be an ERROR and SHALL NOT emit a second, duplicate required-field issue for the same field. Schema-name recognition SHALL be CLI-runtime-driven: the validator SHALL consider a schema name "recognized" when it appears in the union of (a) the built-in fallback set (`VersionSupport.V1_2.getValidSchemas()`) and (b) the CLI-runtime set from `SchemaService.listSchemas()` when CLI is available and supports schema management. Config parsing SHALL be lenient — unrecognized fields and type mismatches SHALL be silently ignored rather than raising parse errors. The config validation inspection SHALL guard against zero-length PSI elements before creating problem descriptors.

#### Scenario: Config absent is accepted
- **WHEN** `openspec/config.yaml` does not exist
- **THEN** the validator SHALL return a clean `ValidationResult` (passed=true, zero issues). This mirrors upstream's `// No config is OK` behavior — the file is augmentation, not a precondition.

#### Scenario: Config parsed successfully
- **WHEN** `openspec/config.yaml` exists and is valid YAML
- **THEN** the validator SHALL proceed with field-level checks

#### Scenario: Config with unknown fields parsed successfully
- **WHEN** `openspec/config.yaml` contains fields not recognized by the Java model
- **THEN** the parser SHALL ignore unknown fields and extract known fields normally

#### Scenario: Config with type mismatches parsed leniently
- **WHEN** an `openspec/config.yaml` field has a YAML type that does not match the expected Java type (e.g., array where string expected)
- **THEN** the parser SHALL skip the mismatched field and use its default value

#### Scenario: Config parse failure returns defaults
- **WHEN** `openspec/config.yaml` is malformed YAML that cannot be parsed at all
- **THEN** the parser SHALL return a default empty config and log at debug level without showing an IDE notification

#### Scenario: Missing schema is a non-failing warning
- **WHEN** `openspec/config.yaml` exists but has no `schema` field (or `schema` is empty)
- **THEN** the validator SHALL report a single WARNING with rule `config-schema-required`, SHALL NOT report `config-field-required` for the same field, and the result SHALL pass — config warnings never fail the verdict, because `openspec validate` never fails on a missing schema (it defaults to `spec-driven`).

#### Scenario: Schema value invalid for version
- **WHEN** the `openspec/config.yaml` `schema` value is neither in the built-in fallback set (`VersionSupport.V1_2.getValidSchemas()`) nor in the CLI-runtime set from `SchemaService.listSchemas()`
- **THEN** the validator SHALL report a WARNING with rule `config-schema-invalid`. The warning text SHALL list the known-set and indicate CLI status (available / unavailable / below floor) so the user understands why a custom-forked schema might not be visible.

#### Scenario: Built-in schema accepted regardless of CLI state
- **WHEN** the `openspec/config.yaml` `schema` value is one of the built-in fallback set (currently `"spec-driven"` or `"workspace-planning"`)
- **THEN** the validator SHALL NOT report `config-schema-invalid` regardless of whether the CLI is available

#### Scenario: Custom-forked schema accepted when CLI lists it
- **WHEN** the CLI is available and supports schema management, AND the user has run `openspec schema fork spec-driven my-team-flow` so `SchemaService.listSchemas()` returns a `SchemaInfo` with name `"my-team-flow"`, AND an `openspec/config.yaml` declares `schema: my-team-flow`
- **THEN** the validator SHALL NOT report `config-schema-invalid`

#### Scenario: Custom-forked schema with no CLI falls back to built-ins
- **WHEN** the CLI is unavailable (or below the 1.3.0 floor) AND an `openspec/config.yaml` declares a non-built-in schema like `my-team-flow`
- **THEN** the validator SHALL report `config-schema-invalid` with text indicating the CLI is unavailable so custom schemas can't be verified

#### Scenario: Typo schema name continues to warn
- **WHEN** the `openspec/config.yaml` `schema` value is a typo of a built-in (e.g., `"spec-drivenn"`) — not in built-ins AND not in the CLI-runtime list
- **THEN** the validator SHALL report `config-schema-invalid` — the broadened recognition does not mask typos

#### Scenario: Version field absent is accepted
- **WHEN** `openspec/config.yaml` has no `version` field (or `version` is empty)
- **THEN** the validator SHALL NOT report any issue. The `version` key is plugin-internal — it is not in upstream's Zod schema and is silently stripped if present at all. `VersionSupport.fromString(null)` defaults to V1_2 so the plugin's runtime behavior is unaffected.

#### Scenario: Version value unrecognized
- **WHEN** the `version` value is set and does not match any known config-format version in `VersionSupport.allVersions()`
- **THEN** the validator SHALL report a WARNING with rule `config-version-unknown`. The check only runs when a value is present; absence is not a warning.

#### Scenario: No required-field enforcement beyond schema
- **WHEN** `openspec/config.yaml` exists and is missing any field other than `schema` (e.g. `context`, `rules`, `version`, `profile`)
- **THEN** the validator SHALL NOT report `config-field-required` for that field. `config-field-required` is no longer emitted; the only required-field rule is `config-schema-required`, covering the sole field upstream's Zod requires. `context` and `rules` are optional and `version`/`profile` are plugin-internal extensions.

#### Scenario: Profile field absent is accepted
- **WHEN** `openspec/config.yaml` has no `profile` field (or `profile` is empty)
- **THEN** the validator SHALL NOT report any issue. Upstream does not read `profile`; the plugin uses it only for tree-view display and AI-prompt context, both null-safe.

#### Scenario: Empty PSI element during config inspection
- **WHEN** `findElementAt()` or `getFirstChild()` returns a zero-length PSI element during config validation
- **THEN** the inspection SHALL walk up via `getParent()` to find a non-empty ancestor and use it for the problem descriptor

#### Scenario: Legacy config-format version 1.0.0 routes to V1_2 baseline
- **WHEN** a `config.yaml` declares `version: 1.0.0` (the legacy V1_0 baseline, removed from `VersionSupport`)
- **THEN** `VersionSupport.fromString("1.0.0")` SHALL return `V1_2`, and the validator SHALL apply V1_2's required-field and required-artifact rules. No crash; no NPE on a missing enum value.

#### Scenario: Legacy config-format version 1.1.0 routes to V1_2 baseline
- **WHEN** a `config.yaml` declares `version: 1.1.0` (the legacy V1_1 baseline, removed from `VersionSupport`)
- **THEN** `VersionSupport.fromString("1.1.0")` SHALL return `V1_2`, and the validator SHALL apply V1_2's rules

#### Scenario: Current and newer config-format versions resolve correctly
- **WHEN** a `config.yaml` declares `version: 1.2.0`, `1.2.99`, `1.3.0`, or `1.4.x`
- **THEN** `VersionSupport.fromString` SHALL return `V1_2` for all (V1_2 is the only baseline; future format versions will add their own enum entries when they change the config-format shape)

### Requirement: Spec format validation

The plugin SHALL validate spec files for structural completeness: title heading, requirement blocks, RFC 2119 keywords, and scenario format. When the built-in validator is the verdict (the CLI is absent — see "CLI verdict is authoritative when the CLI is available"), its default-mode verdict for a main spec SHALL NOT exceed the verdict `openspec validate` produces for the same file in its default mode — the plugin MUST NOT be more restrictive than the client it wraps. Accordingly, on the main-spec path (`openspec/specs/**`), the two conditions the real CLI reports `valid` SHALL be demoted below ERROR: a missing `# Title` heading SHALL be a WARNING (rule `spec-title-required`), because the CLI requires no H1 and derives the spec name from the directory; and a scenario missing a `WHEN` or `THEN` clause SHALL be an INFO (rule `spec-scenario-clauses`), because the CLI performs no clause-structure check. A requirement with no `#### Scenario:` block SHALL remain an ERROR (rule `spec-scenario-required`): the real CLI reports such a requirement `valid:false` — it enforces `.min(1)` scenarios as a schema-level error in addition to its WARNING guide — so demoting it would make the plugin laxer than the CLI. A missing requirement block (`spec-requirement-required`) and the RFC-keyword rules SHALL likewise remain ERROR, because the CLI errors on those. Requirement headers (`### Requirement:`) SHALL be recognized case-insensitively on the header token, matching OpenSpec CLI 1.4+ parsing. Requirement-keyword presence SHALL be satisfied only by `SHALL` or `MUST` as whole words (matching the CLI's rule on every supported generation — `SHOULD`/`MAY` do not satisfy it), SHALL be evaluated against the requirement body with fenced code blocks masked (matching CLI 1.6 semantics — a keyword appearing only inside a code fence does not satisfy the check), and a keyword appearing only in the requirement header SHALL produce a targeted diagnostic directing the author to move the keyword onto a body line, with a quick-fix offered. Scenario presence (`#### Scenario:`) SHALL likewise be evaluated with fenced code blocks masked. The inspection SHALL guard against zero-length PSI elements and invalid offsets before creating problem descriptors.

#### Scenario: Missing title heading warns, does not fail
- **WHEN** a spec file has no `# Title` heading and the built-in validator is the verdict
- **THEN** the validator SHALL report a WARNING with code `spec-title-required`, and the file's verdict SHALL NOT fail on that account, because the CLI requires no H1

#### Scenario: Otherwise-valid spec without a title passes
- **WHEN** a spec file has no `# Title` heading but has a requirement block with a SHALL/MUST body line and at least one scenario
- **THEN** the built-in validator SHALL report the `spec-title-required` WARNING and still return a passing verdict (no ERROR), matching the CLI which validates the same file clean

#### Scenario: Missing requirement block
- **WHEN** a spec file has no `### Requirement:` section
- **THEN** the validator SHALL report an ERROR with code `spec-requirement-required`

#### Scenario: SHOULD-only requirement is flagged
- **WHEN** a requirement's body contains `SHOULD` or `MAY` but neither `SHALL` nor `MUST` as a whole word
- **THEN** the validator SHALL report the missing-keyword ERROR, because the CLI accepts only SHALL/MUST

#### Scenario: Keyword only inside a code fence is not accepted
- **WHEN** a requirement's only `SHALL`/`MUST` occurrence sits inside a fenced code block
- **THEN** the validator SHALL report the missing-keyword ERROR, matching CLI 1.6 fence masking

#### Scenario: Requirement without a scenario is an error
- **WHEN** a main-spec requirement (outside a change delta) has a SHALL/MUST body line but no `#### Scenario:` block
- **THEN** the validator SHALL report an ERROR with code `spec-scenario-required`, and the file's verdict SHALL fail, matching the CLI which reports such a requirement `valid:false`

#### Scenario: Scenario header only inside a code fence is an error
- **WHEN** a requirement's only `#### Scenario:` header sits inside a fenced code block (so the requirement is effectively scenarioless after fence masking)
- **THEN** the validator SHALL report the `spec-scenario-required` ERROR, applying CLI 1.6 fence-aware scenario counting

#### Scenario: Scenario missing WHEN or THEN is informational only
- **WHEN** a `#### Scenario:` block is missing a `WHEN` clause, a `THEN` clause, or both
- **THEN** the validator SHALL report an INFO with code `spec-scenario-clauses` and the file's verdict SHALL be unaffected, because the CLI performs no clause-structure validation

#### Scenario: Verdict parity with the 1.6 CLI on demoted main-spec rules
- **WHEN** a main spec that the captured real 1.6.0 CLI reports `valid` (e.g. one that is untitled, or has a clauseless scenario, but no ERROR-class problem) is validated by the built-in validator in default mode
- **THEN** the built-in validator SHALL also report it passing, so the plugin's fallback verdict matches the CLI's `valid` flag for every such case

### Requirement: Per-run strict validation

The plugin SHALL offer strict validation as a **per-invocation choice**, not a persistent setting, mirroring the upstream OpenSpec CLI's `validate --strict` flag (which has no durable state). There SHALL be no persisted strict preference — no settings toggle, no `config.yaml` key, no stored state. Strict SHALL be selected per run via a dedicated `OpenSpec.ValidateStrict` action (distinct from the default `OpenSpec.Validate`), exposed as a compact toolbar dropdown alongside the default Validate, as an adjacent menu leaf, and discoverable via Find Action. The default Validate SHALL remain non-strict.

A strict run SHALL be threaded as a per-invocation boolean, never stored on any shared service. When the CLI is available, the plugin SHALL pass `--strict` to `openspec validate` and derive the verdict from the CLI's own `valid` field (which under `--strict` is `errors==0 && warnings==0`). When the CLI is absent, the built-in fallback verdict SHALL fail under strict on any ERROR or any non-config WARNING — as a verdict flip only, without re-labeling any issue's severity. `config.yaml` guidance stays non-failing in both modes (the CLI never fails on config), so strict means the same thing whether or not the CLI is present.

A strict run SHALL never be silent: the summary notification SHALL identify strict (title `Validate (strict)`), a warnings-only strict failure SHALL append an explanation (`— strict: warnings count as failures`) after the pass/fail summary, and the console SHALL echo the `--strict` command (`openspec validate --all --strict`). The literal `passed (` / `failed (` summary tokens SHALL be preserved.

#### Scenario: Strict is a per-run action, not a persistent setting
- **WHEN** the user wants strict validation
- **THEN** they SHALL invoke the `OpenSpec.ValidateStrict` action (toolbar dropdown, menu, or Find Action); there SHALL be no persistent "strict validation" setting anywhere

#### Scenario: Default Validate is non-strict
- **WHEN** the user invokes the default `OpenSpec.Validate`
- **THEN** the run SHALL use the CLI/plugin default verdict (warnings do not fail), with no `--strict` passed to the CLI

#### Scenario: Strict passes --strict to the CLI when present
- **WHEN** a strict run executes with the CLI available
- **THEN** the CLI invocation SHALL include `--strict`, the console SHALL echo `openspec validate --all --strict`, and the verdict SHALL come from each item's `valid` field

#### Scenario: CLI-absent strict flips the verdict on warnings
- **WHEN** a strict run executes with the CLI absent and the built-in fallback produces a result with zero errors but one or more warnings
- **THEN** the verdict SHALL be FAILED (strict flips the threshold), the warning issues SHALL remain labeled WARNING (not re-severity-ed), and the result SHALL disclose that strict counted the warnings as failures

#### Scenario: Strict discloses itself in the summary
- **WHEN** a strict run completes
- **THEN** the summary notification title SHALL read `Validate (strict)`; a warnings-only failure SHALL append `— strict: warnings count as failures` after the `failed (…)` summary, preserving the `failed (` token

#### Scenario: One-time migration notice for a prior strict-on user
- **WHEN** the plugin upgrades and detects that the removed persistent `strictValidation` setting had been enabled
- **THEN** it SHALL show a single one-time notification directing the user to the per-run `Validate (Strict)` action, then never show it again; a user on the default (off) SHALL see no notice

### Requirement: Change validation

The plugin SHALL validate each active change's `.openspec.yaml` for schema compatibility with the project's declared version. Schema-name recognition SHALL be CLI-runtime-driven on the same principle as `Config validation`: a change schema is "recognized" when it appears in the union of the built-in fallback set (`VersionSupport.V1_2.getValidSchemas()`) and the CLI-runtime set from `SchemaService.listSchemas()`. The validator SHALL use `VersionSupport.getValidSchemas()` only as the built-in fallback portion of that union, not as the canonical valid-set. The `change-artifact-missing` rule (a plugin-invented lint for a missing required artifact — the CLI never checks artifact-file presence) SHALL always be a non-failing WARNING; it SHALL NOT be escalated to ERROR by any persistent setting. Under a per-run strict validation (see `Per-run strict validation`) it fails the verdict only via the strict warnings-count-as-failures rule, remaining labeled WARNING.

#### Scenario: Proposal required
- **WHEN** a change has no `proposal.md`
- **THEN** the validator SHALL report an ERROR with rule `change-proposal-required`

#### Scenario: Required artifacts for version
- **WHEN** the declared version requires specific artifacts and a change is missing one
- **THEN** the validator SHALL report a WARNING with rule `change-artifact-missing` — always a non-failing WARNING, never escalated to ERROR by a persistent setting

#### Scenario: Change schema incompatible with project version
- **WHEN** a change's `.openspec.yaml` declares a schema that is neither in the built-in fallback set nor in `SchemaService.listSchemas()`
- **THEN** the validator SHALL report a WARNING with rule `change-schema-incompatible`. The warning text SHALL list the known-set and indicate CLI status so the user understands why a custom-forked schema might not be visible.

#### Scenario: Custom-forked schema accepted for change when CLI lists it
- **WHEN** the user has forked a custom schema via `openspec schema fork` AND a change's `.openspec.yaml` declares that custom schema
- **THEN** the validator SHALL NOT report `change-schema-incompatible`

### Requirement: workspace-planning schema acceptance

The plugin SHALL accept `workspace-planning` as a valid workflow schema for projects on schema-version baseline V1_2 or later, alongside the original `spec-driven` schema. Projects on V1_0 or V1_1 SHALL continue to accept only `spec-driven`, because `workspace-planning` was introduced upstream in OpenSpec CLI 1.4.x.

#### Scenario: workspace-planning accepted under V1_2
- **WHEN** a project declares `version: 1.2.x` (or any version that resolves to `VersionSupport.V1_2`) and a change's `.openspec.yaml` declares `schema: workspace-planning`
- **THEN** the validator SHALL NOT report `change-schema-incompatible`

#### Scenario: spec-driven still accepted under V1_2
- **WHEN** a project declares `version: 1.2.x` and a change's `.openspec.yaml` declares `schema: spec-driven`
- **THEN** the validator SHALL NOT report `change-schema-incompatible`

#### Scenario: workspace-planning rejected under V1_0
- **WHEN** a project declares `version: 1.0.x` (resolving to `VersionSupport.V1_0`) and a change's `.openspec.yaml` declares `schema: workspace-planning`
- **THEN** the validator SHALL report a WARNING with rule `change-schema-incompatible`

#### Scenario: workspace-planning rejected under V1_1
- **WHEN** a project declares `version: 1.1.x` (resolving to `VersionSupport.V1_1`) and a change's `.openspec.yaml` declares `schema: workspace-planning`
- **THEN** the validator SHALL report a WARNING with rule `change-schema-incompatible`

### Requirement: Delta spec validation

The plugin SHALL validate delta spec files for structural correctness, including section headings (ADDED, MODIFIED, REMOVED, RENAMED), removal metadata, scenario coverage, and rename FROM/TO structure. Keyword and scenario evaluation SHALL apply the same fence masking as spec-format validation. Non-canonical level-3 headers inside ADDED or MODIFIED sections — headers the upstream parser skips — SHALL produce an INFO-severity issue anchored to the header's line, mirroring CLI 1.6's advisory: a nameless requirement header (`### Requirement:` with no name) SHALL be hinted to add a name, and any other level-3 header SHALL be hinted that it is ignored by validation unless written as `### Requirement: <name>`. INFO-severity issues SHALL never affect the file's validation verdict.

#### Scenario: Missing delta sections
- **WHEN** a delta spec file under a change's `specs/` directory has no ADDED, MODIFIED, REMOVED, or RENAMED sections
- **THEN** the validator SHALL report a WARNING with code `delta-spec-sections`

#### Scenario: Removed requirement missing metadata
- **WHEN** a REMOVED requirement block is missing a **Reason** field or a **Migration** field (recognizing both the `**Reason:**` colon-inside and `**Reason**:` colon-outside bold forms)
- **THEN** the validator SHALL report a WARNING with code `delta-removed-fields`
- **AND** the validator SHALL NOT report this as an ERROR, because Reason/Migration are an OpenSpec authoring convention only — the upstream `@fission-ai/openspec` client validates REMOVED blocks by name and does not require these fields, so the plugin must not be stricter than the client it wraps

#### Scenario: Added requirement missing scenario
- **WHEN** an ADDED requirement block has no `#### Scenario:` section
- **THEN** the validator SHALL report an ERROR with code `delta-requirement-scenario`

#### Scenario: Modified requirement missing scenario
- **WHEN** a MODIFIED requirement block has no `#### Scenario:` section with updated content
- **THEN** the validator SHALL report an ERROR with code `delta-requirement-scenario`

#### Scenario: Non-canonical header in a delta section gets an INFO hint
- **WHEN** an ADDED or MODIFIED section contains a level-3 header that is not a named `### Requirement:` header (e.g. `### Implementation notes`, or a nameless `### Requirement:`)
- **THEN** the validator SHALL report an INFO-severity issue with code `delta-skipped-header` anchored to that header's line, and the file's verdict SHALL be unaffected by it

#### Scenario: Renamed section missing FROM/TO
- **WHEN** a `## RENAMED Requirements` section contains no well-formed `FROM:`/`TO:` pair (matching `^\s*(?:-\s*)?FROM:\s*(.+)$\s*^\s*(?:-\s*)?TO:\s*(.+)$`, mirroring the sync layer's parser)
- **THEN** the validator SHALL report an ERROR with code `delta-renamed-fields`

#### Scenario: Renamed section with valid FROM/TO
- **WHEN** a `## RENAMED Requirements` section contains one or more well-formed `FROM:`/`TO:` pairs (bullet or non-bullet form)
- **THEN** the validator SHALL NOT report `delta-renamed-fields` or `delta-spec-sections` for that file

#### Scenario: Verdict parity with the 1.6 CLI
- **WHEN** the verdict-parity corpus (specs and delta files exercising the keyword, fence, scenario, and skipped-header rule classes) is validated by the plugin and by the captured real 1.6.0 CLI output
- **THEN** the plugin's per-case valid/invalid verdict SHALL match the CLI's `valid` flag for every case

### Requirement: Delta spec IDE inspection

The plugin SHALL provide a real-time IDE inspection for delta spec files, highlighting structural problems as the user edits. For MODIFIED requirements missing scenarios, the inspection SHALL offer a quick-fix that copies the full requirement block from the corresponding main spec. The inspection SHALL guard against zero-length PSI elements by walking up the PSI tree before creating problem descriptors.

#### Scenario: Inspection scope
- **WHEN** a file is located under `openspec/changes/<change>/specs/` and is named `spec.md`
- **THEN** the plugin SHALL apply delta spec inspections to that file

#### Scenario: Inspection highlights problems inline
- **WHEN** a delta spec file has an ADDED requirement missing a scenario
- **THEN** the IDE SHALL display an inline error highlight at the relevant location
- **WHEN** a delta spec file has a REMOVED requirement missing **Reason**/**Migration** metadata
- **THEN** the IDE SHALL display an inline warning highlight (advisory, not an error — see the `delta-removed-fields` rule above)

#### Scenario: Quick-fix for MODIFIED requirement missing scenarios
- **WHEN** a MODIFIED requirement has no `#### Scenario:` section and the requirement exists in the main spec
- **THEN** the inspection SHALL offer a quick-fix that replaces the requirement block with the full content from `openspec/specs/<capability>/spec.md`

#### Scenario: Quick-fix unavailable when main spec missing
- **WHEN** a MODIFIED requirement has no scenarios but no matching requirement exists in the main spec
- **THEN** the inspection SHALL report the error without offering a quick-fix

#### Scenario: Empty PSI element at inspection offset
- **WHEN** `findElementAt()` returns a zero-length PSI element for a problem location
- **THEN** the inspection SHALL walk up via `getParent()` to find a non-empty ancestor element and use it for the problem descriptor

#### Scenario: No non-empty PSI element available
- **WHEN** no non-empty PSI element can be found at or above the target offset
- **THEN** the inspection SHALL skip registering that problem descriptor rather than crashing

### Requirement: Scaffolding content detection

The plugin SHALL distinguish between scaffolding placeholder content and real authored content, overriding artifact status accordingly.

#### Scenario: Placeholder detection
- **WHEN** an artifact file contains only template placeholders or boilerplate headings with no substantive content
- **THEN** the plugin SHALL report the artifact as scaffolding and override its status to READY (not DONE)

### Requirement: Artifact file watching

The plugin SHALL auto-detect artifact file changes via VFS listeners and refresh pipeline status after clipboard or editor delivery.

#### Scenario: File save triggers refresh
- **WHEN** a user saves an artifact file after pasting AI-generated content
- **THEN** the plugin SHALL detect the VFS change and update the artifact's pipeline status

### Requirement: Validate from the Project View context menu

The plugin SHALL offer a Validate action in the IDE's Project View context menu, visible only when the current selection is under an `openspec/` directory. Invoking it SHALL validate the change or spec that owns the clicked file, resolved by mapping the file's path up to its owning directory: a selection under `openspec/specs/<capability>/` SHALL validate that spec; a selection under `openspec/changes/<name>/` for an active (non-archived) change SHALL validate that change; a selection under `openspec/changes/archive/`, at the `openspec/` root, or on a non-item file such as `config.yaml` SHALL fall back to validating the whole project. The action SHALL reuse the shared validation pipeline — the CLI verdict authoritative for specs/changes when the CLI is available, the built-in validator as the fallback when it is not, and the built-in validator as the sole owner of `config.yaml` checks — scoped to the resolved target. It SHALL NOT fabricate a per-file valid/invalid verdict, and its visibility check SHALL be inexpensive (a path check, no blocking I/O or CLI call).

#### Scenario: Menu item hidden outside openspec
- **WHEN** the user right-clicks a file that is not under an `openspec/` directory
- **THEN** the Validate OpenSpec menu item SHALL NOT be shown

#### Scenario: Validating a spec from the tree
- **WHEN** the user right-clicks a file under `openspec/specs/<capability>/` and invokes Validate
- **THEN** the plugin SHALL validate that spec (not the whole project) and report the result to the console

#### Scenario: Validating a change from the tree
- **WHEN** the user right-clicks a file under an active change's `openspec/changes/<name>/` and invokes Validate
- **THEN** the plugin SHALL validate that change and report the result

#### Scenario: Non-item selection falls back to whole-project
- **WHEN** the user invokes Validate on a selection under `openspec/changes/archive/`, at the `openspec/` root, or on `config.yaml`
- **THEN** the plugin SHALL validate the whole project rather than fabricating a single-item verdict for a non-validatable target

### Requirement: Validation result presentation

The plugin SHALL present validation results in the OpenSpec console as a structured, navigable report rather than a single uniform-color text block. Results SHALL be grouped by file: each distinct issue file path SHALL be a group header, with that file's issues listed beneath it. Files containing at least one ERROR SHALL be ordered before warning-only files, then info-only files; within a group, issues SHALL be ordered by line ascending. Each issue's reported location (`line`, or the file path in the group header) SHALL render as a clickable hyperlink that opens the file at the reported line in the editor when the path resolves to a file on disk. The presentation SHALL reflect only the existing issue model — severity is exactly ERROR, WARNING, or INFO, and each issue carries a file path, line, message, and rule — and SHALL NOT introduce a per-file pass/fail verdict (file headers are grouping keys only) or any new severity. Each severity SHALL render in a distinct, theme-driven console content type. Rendering SHALL run on the UI thread, consistent with the existing result-display path.

This presentation SHALL be produced by the single shared result-rendering path, so every caller — the toolbar Validate, the Project-View scoped Validate, and any future caller — benefits identically. The at-a-glance notification balloon SHALL remain the summary surface and SHALL NOT enumerate individual issues; the console SHALL be the detailed, navigable surface.

#### Scenario: Header states verdict, target, and counts
- **WHEN** a validation run completes for a target (whole project, a change, or a spec)
- **THEN** the console SHALL show a verdict line naming the target (e.g. `Validation FAILED — Change <name>` or `Validation PASSED — <target>`) followed by a count line summarizing the number of errors, warnings, and infos

#### Scenario: Issues grouped by file, errors-first
- **WHEN** a failing result contains issues across multiple files
- **THEN** the console SHALL present each file as a group header with its issues beneath, ordering files that contain an ERROR before warning-only files and info-only files, and ordering issues within a file by line ascending

#### Scenario: Resolvable location is a clickable hyperlink
- **WHEN** an issue carries a file path that resolves to a file on disk and a 1-based line
- **THEN** the console SHALL render that issue's location as a hyperlink that, when clicked, opens the file with the caret at the reported line (mapping the 1-based line to the editor's 0-based position)

#### Scenario: Unresolvable location degrades to plain text
- **WHEN** an issue carries a path that does not resolve to a file on disk (e.g. a CLI-reported `type/id` pseudo-path) or has no usable line
- **THEN** the console SHALL render that issue as plain, still-severity-colored text with no hyperlink, rather than a dead link or an error

#### Scenario: Severity determines color
- **WHEN** issues of differing severity are rendered
- **THEN** ERROR, WARNING, and INFO SHALL each render in a distinct, theme-driven console content type so severity is distinguishable, and no new severity beyond ERROR/WARNING/INFO SHALL be introduced

#### Scenario: Clean pass shows a concise confirmation
- **WHEN** a validation run passes with zero issues
- **THEN** the console SHALL show a concise pass confirmation naming the target and a "no issues" line, rather than an empty or ambiguous block

#### Scenario: Passing-with-warnings still lists the warnings
- **WHEN** a run passes (no errors) but reports one or more warnings or infos
- **THEN** the console SHALL show the pass verdict and count line and still list the warning/info issues grouped by file

#### Scenario: Presentation invents no per-file verdict
- **WHEN** results are grouped under file headers
- **THEN** the file headers SHALL serve only as grouping keys and SHALL NOT display a per-file valid/invalid badge, because the model carries a single result-level verdict and no per-file verdict
