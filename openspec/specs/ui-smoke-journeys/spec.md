# UI Smoke Journeys

## Purpose
Automated rendered-UI smoke coverage: scope, journeys, execution policy, and flakiness handling for the Starter/Driver-based suite.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Rendered-UI smoke journeys exist

The project SHALL maintain a small suite (currently eleven) of automated UI smoke journeys that drive a real sandbox IDE with the plugin installed, asserting presence and wiring of rendered surfaces. Journeys SHALL assert component presence and wiring, not textual prose or pixels, and SHALL NOT mutate durable user state (dialog journeys exit via cancel; no archive is performed). A journey that must exercise state-writing actions SHALL isolate that state to journey-scoped temporary locations — e.g. an isolated OpenSpec data directory injected via the IDE process environment — so nothing outlives the journey or touches the user's real data.

#### Scenario: Open-and-render journey
- **WHEN** the smoke suite opens a seeded demo project
- **THEN** it SHALL assert the OpenSpec tool window opens and the Browse tree shows the seeded spec and change

#### Scenario: Update cleanup journey
- **WHEN** the smoke suite triggers the Update action in a project seeded with legacy files
- **THEN** it SHALL assert the review notification appears with its action

#### Scenario: Settings journey
- **WHEN** the smoke suite opens the plugin's Settings page
- **THEN** it SHALL assert the Schemas section renders with the built-in schema row

#### Scenario: Editor validator-parity journey
- **WHEN** the smoke suite opens the seeded lowercase-header spec, a seeded keyword-in-header-only spec, and a seeded spec whose only keyword sits inside a fenced code block
- **THEN** it SHALL assert via the highlighting daemon that the lowercase header draws no requirement-recognition complaint, that the keyword-in-header spec draws the targeted move-the-keyword diagnostic, and that the fenced-keyword spec draws the missing-keyword diagnostic (CLI 1.6 fence masking)

#### Scenario: Archive guard journey
- **WHEN** the smoke suite invokes Archive on the seeded incomplete change
- **THEN** it SHALL assert the incomplete-change confirmation surface appears, cancel it, and assert the change directory was not moved

#### Scenario: Store-health journey (CLI 1.6 semantics)
- **WHEN** the smoke suite runs against a host CLI at 1.6+ with an isolated OpenSpec data directory, a pre-registered fresh/config-only store, and prepared store roots (a pointer-declaring root, a never-a-store root, and a fresh root with store identity)
- **THEN** it SHALL assert the fresh store's row renders with no unhealthy or metadata error marker, that registering the pointer-declaring and never-a-store roots surfaces the CLI's refusal/confirmation message and fix in the write-failure dialog (dismissed without confirming), and that registering the identified fresh root succeeds and lists a new row with no error marker; on a host CLI below 1.6 the journey SHALL be skipped, not failed

#### Scenario: Validate-results journey (CLI-parsed errors reach the rendered results)
- **WHEN** the smoke suite, on a 1.6+ host CLI, seeds a spec whose requirement lacks SHALL/MUST, opens the plugin tool window, and triggers the Validate action
- **THEN** it SHALL assert the validation summary notification reports the failure and that the plugin's Console surface renders the CLI-parsed error line for that spec (identified by the CLI parser's `type/id` path form, not satisfiable by the built-in validator's duplicate); on a host CLI below 1.6 the journey SHALL be skipped, not failed

#### Scenario: Spec-viewer preview journey
- **WHEN** the smoke suite selects a spec's requirement node in the Browse tree (via the tree model API)
- **THEN** it SHALL assert the preview pane renders the selected spec's markdown, detected by the preview pane's accessible name flipping to its rendered state (a surface visible only after the selection → pooled-read → render wiring fires)

#### Scenario: Change-deltas preview journey
- **WHEN** the smoke suite, on a 1.6+ host CLI, selects a change node whose seeded delta the consolidated view can badge
- **THEN** it SHALL assert the preview pane renders the change's CLI-sourced deltas grouped by capability with operation badges, detected by the pane's badged-deltas accessible-name state; on a host CLI below 1.6 the journey SHALL be skipped, not failed

#### Scenario: Grouped validation report journey
- **WHEN** the smoke suite seeds a project with a deliberate spec error and a schemaless config, opens the tool window, and triggers the Validate action
- **THEN** it SHALL assert the Console renders the structured report — the FAILED verdict line naming the target, the error/warning/info count line, the per-capability group headers, a severity label on a grouped row, and a clickable line-number token on the resolvable config warning — so the grouped, per-severity, hyperlinked format is exercised end to end

#### Scenario: Validate (Strict) disclosure journey
- **WHEN** the smoke suite opens the tool window and invokes the `OpenSpec.ValidateStrict` action
- **THEN** it SHALL assert the strict run discloses itself in surfaces a default Validate never produces — the summary balloon title `Validate (strict)` and the Console echo of the `--strict` command flag — targeting the strict-specific wiring rather than the verdict

### Requirement: Smoke journeys never gate ordinary PRs

The UI smoke job SHALL run on manual dispatch and as part of the release pipeline, and SHALL NOT be a required check on ordinary pull requests. A release tag SHALL require green smoke journeys before publishing.

#### Scenario: PR unaffected
- **WHEN** an ordinary pull request runs CI
- **THEN** the UI smoke job SHALL NOT run and SHALL NOT block the merge

#### Scenario: Release gated
- **WHEN** a release tag is pushed
- **THEN** the pipeline SHALL require the smoke journeys to pass for that commit before publishing

### Requirement: Failure diagnosability

Each failed journey SHALL upload diagnosable artifacts — the sandbox IDE log and a full-screen screenshot — and a journey exceeding its timeout SHALL fail with artifacts rather than hang the job.

#### Scenario: Journey failure artifacts
- **WHEN** a smoke journey fails or times out
- **THEN** the job SHALL attach the IDE log and a screenshot for that journey

### Requirement: Shared seeding with the manual test-drive

The smoke journeys' demo-project seeding SHALL share a single source with the manual test-drive tooling, so the automated and human walkthrough environments cannot drift apart.

#### Scenario: One seeding source
- **WHEN** the demo-project seeding recipe changes
- **THEN** both the manual test-drive and the smoke journeys SHALL pick up the change from the same source
