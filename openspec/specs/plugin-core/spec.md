# Plugin Core

## Purpose
Core infrastructure: project detection, configuration, file operations, API compatibility, notifications, and service lifecycle.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Project detection and initialization

The plugin SHALL detect OpenSpec projects by checking for `openspec/` and provide initialization via CLI delegation with built-in fallback. The built-in fallback SHALL honor the user's configured Default schema preference when writing `openspec/config.yaml`, falling back to `spec-driven` only when no preference is set. The built-in fallback SHALL write **only the fields upstream `openspec init` writes** — a `schema:` line and nothing else — and SHALL NOT write plugin-invented fields (`version:`, `profile:`) or empty upstream fields (`context: ""`, `rules: {}`) that upstream's Zod schema ignores. The plugin MAY still read `version:`/`profile:` from an existing (legacy) `config.yaml` for display, but SHALL NOT emit them into a config it generates.

#### Scenario: Project detection
- **WHEN** a project is opened in the IDE
- **THEN** the plugin SHALL check for `openspec/` directory and enable/disable features accordingly

#### Scenario: Init delegates to CLI when available
- **WHEN** `ScaffoldingService.initOpenSpec()` is called and the CLI is detected
- **THEN** it SHALL run `openspec init --tools <detected-tools>` and perform a synchronous VFS refresh

#### Scenario: Init falls back to built-in
- **WHEN** the CLI is unavailable or fails
- **THEN** the service SHALL create `openspec/config.yaml`, `specs/`, `changes/`, and `changes/archive/` via VFS

#### Scenario: Default schema honored on built-in init
- **WHEN** the user has set Default schema to a value other than empty (e.g., `workspace-planning`) in Settings → Tools → OpenSpec, and the built-in init path runs
- **THEN** the generated `openspec/config.yaml` SHALL contain `schema:` matching the user's chosen value, not the hardcoded literal `spec-driven`

#### Scenario: Default schema fallback when unset
- **WHEN** the user has not set Default schema (the setting is empty), and the built-in init path runs
- **THEN** the generated `openspec/config.yaml` SHALL contain `schema: spec-driven` (preserving the prior default behavior)

#### Scenario: Built-in init writes a schema-only config
- **WHEN** the built-in init path generates `openspec/config.yaml`
- **THEN** the file SHALL contain a `schema:` line and SHALL NOT contain a `version:` field, a `profile:` block, or empty `context:`/`rules:` entries — matching upstream `openspec init`, which writes only `schema:`

#### Scenario: Legacy config with plugin-invented fields still reads
- **WHEN** an existing `openspec/config.yaml` (from a prior plugin version) contains `version:` and/or `profile:`
- **THEN** the plugin SHALL still parse it and still surface those values in the tree view — only newly-scaffolded configs omit them

### Requirement: Configuration parsing

The plugin SHALL parse `openspec/config.yaml` and surface clear errors for malformed YAML in both `config.yaml` and `.openspec.yaml`. The plugin SHALL support reading the active profile's workflow configuration when the CLI is available. The plugin SHALL persist a default schema preference in `OpenSpecSettings.State` and expose it via getter/setter methods.

#### Scenario: Valid config
- **WHEN** a valid `config.yaml` exists
- **THEN** all config values SHALL be accessible via ConfigService

#### Scenario: Malformed YAML
- **WHEN** `config.yaml` or `.openspec.yaml` contains invalid YAML
- **THEN** the plugin SHALL show a warning notification with file path and parse error

#### Scenario: Profile config retrieval via CLI
- **WHEN** the CLI is detected and `openspec config profile --json` succeeds
- **THEN** the plugin SHALL make profile name, description, and active workflows available to the Settings panel

#### Scenario: Profile config retrieval without CLI
- **WHEN** the CLI is not detected
- **THEN** the plugin SHALL fall back to the locally-stored profile name in OpenSpecSettings without workflow details

#### Scenario: Default schema persistence
- **WHEN** the user selects a default schema in Settings
- **THEN** the value SHALL be persisted in `OpenSpecSettings.State.defaultSchema` and available via `OpenSpecSettings.getDefaultSchema()`

### Requirement: AI tool detection

The plugin SHALL detect all 30 AI tools supported by the OpenSpec CLI 1.4.x using directory scanning, with type classification (CLI vs IDE_PANEL) and CLI ID mapping. The plugin's `CLI_TOOL_IDS` mapping SHALL match the upstream `value` strings in `@fission-ai/openspec/dist/core/config.js` so that any CLI invocation issued by the plugin uses a registry-recognized tool ID.

#### Scenario: Tool detection
- **WHEN** `AiToolDetectionService.detect()` scans the project root
- **THEN** it SHALL check all 30 tool directories and classify each as CLI or IDE_PANEL

#### Scenario: Junie detected as IDE panel
- **WHEN** the project root contains a `.junie` directory
- **THEN** the plugin SHALL list "Junie" in detected tools, classified as IDE_PANEL, with CLI ID `junie`

#### Scenario: Lingma detected as IDE panel
- **WHEN** the project root contains a `.lingma` directory
- **THEN** the plugin SHALL list "Lingma" in detected tools, classified as IDE_PANEL, with CLI ID `lingma`

#### Scenario: ForgeCode detected as CLI tool
- **WHEN** the project root contains a `.forge` directory (the upstream-emitted directory for ForgeCode)
- **THEN** the plugin SHALL list "ForgeCode" in detected tools, classified as CLI, with CLI ID `forgecode`

#### Scenario: Bob Shell detected as CLI tool
- **WHEN** the project root contains a `.bob` directory
- **THEN** the plugin SHALL list "Bob Shell" in detected tools, classified as CLI, with CLI ID `bob`

#### Scenario: Kimi CLI detected as CLI tool
- **WHEN** the project root contains a `.kimi` directory
- **THEN** the plugin SHALL list "Kimi CLI" in detected tools, classified as CLI, with CLI ID `kimi`

#### Scenario: Mistral Vibe detected as CLI tool
- **WHEN** the project root contains a `.vibe` directory
- **THEN** the plugin SHALL list "Mistral Vibe" in detected tools, classified as CLI, with CLI ID `vibe`

#### Scenario: ForgeCode directory key differs from CLI ID
- **WHEN** the plugin maps display name "ForgeCode" to a CLI ID
- **THEN** it SHALL emit `forgecode` (matching upstream `--tools forgecode`), even though the directory key in `TOOL_DIRS` is `.forge`

#### Scenario: Pre-1.3.x tools still detected
- **WHEN** any of the pre-1.3.x tool directories (`.claude`, `.github`, `.cursor`, `.windsurf`, `.cline`, `.gemini`, `.amazonq`, `.agent`, `.augment`, `.codex`, `.codebuddy`, `.continue`, `.cospec`, `.crush`, `.factory`, `.iflow`, `.kilocode`, `.kiro`, `.opencode`, `.pi`, `.qoder`, `.qwen`, `.roo`, `.trae`) exists in the project root
- **THEN** the plugin SHALL list its corresponding tool with the same display name, type, and CLI ID it used prior to the 1.3.x and 1.4.x registry expansions, ensuring no regression for existing users.

### Requirement: VFS-consistent file operations

All file writes that create or update content SHALL use plain filesystem I/O (`java.nio.file`) on background threads. VFS refresh operations (`LocalFileSystem.refreshAndFindFileByPath`, `VirtualFile.refresh`) SHALL be performed within `WriteAction` on the EDT. CLI-created files SHALL be followed by synchronous VFS refresh. Tool window refresh SHALL use `syncRefresh()`.

#### Scenario: Files visible after write
- **WHEN** the plugin writes files (init, propose, generate)
- **THEN** they SHALL be immediately visible in the project tree without async delay

#### Scenario: File write does not require WriteAction
- **WHEN** the plugin writes file content via `Files.writeString()` or equivalent
- **THEN** the write SHALL execute outside of `WriteAction` and outside of `invokeAndWait`

#### Scenario: VFS refresh requires WriteAction
- **WHEN** the plugin needs to refresh the virtual file system after a file write
- **THEN** the VFS refresh SHALL execute within `WriteAction` on the EDT

### Requirement: API compatibility

The plugin SHALL avoid scheduled-for-removal APIs and use recommended replacements where available for the supported platform range (2024.2+).

#### Scenario: Plugin Verifier
- **WHEN** Plugin Verifier runs across supported IDE versions
- **THEN** zero override-only violations SHALL be reported

### Requirement: File type registration

The plugin SHALL register `.openspec.yaml` as a custom file type and provide distinct icons for spec files, delta specs, and OpenSpec YAML files.

#### Scenario: File type icons
- **WHEN** a user views `openspec/` files in the project tree
- **THEN** spec files, delta specs, and `.openspec.yaml` files SHALL display their custom icons

### Requirement: Notification system

The plugin SHALL deliver categorized notifications with titles, actions, and bulk operation summaries. API errors SHALL include human-readable messages with actionable suggestions.

#### Scenario: Notifications
- **WHEN** the plugin reports status to the user
- **THEN** notifications SHALL use registered groups, include contextual titles, and provide action links where appropriate

### Requirement: CLI re-detection on tool window activation

The plugin SHALL re-run CLI detection when the OpenSpec tool window is activated (shown). Detection SHALL be throttled to skip if the last detection was within the last 30 seconds. After re-detection, the status bar SHALL update to reflect the current CLI availability.

#### Scenario: Tool window activated with stale detection
- **WHEN** the OpenSpec tool window is shown and the last detection was more than 30 seconds ago
- **THEN** the plugin SHALL re-run CLI detection on a background thread and update the status bar on the EDT

#### Scenario: Tool window activated with fresh detection
- **WHEN** the OpenSpec tool window is shown and the last detection was within 30 seconds
- **THEN** the plugin SHALL skip re-detection

#### Scenario: CLI installed after project open
- **WHEN** the user installs the OpenSpec CLI after the project is opened and then activates the tool window
- **THEN** the status bar SHALL update to show "CLI: available" after re-detection completes

### Requirement: CLI version floor notification

The plugin SHALL show a one-time notification when an OpenSpec project is opened and the detected CLI version is older than the supported floor of 1.3.0. The notification SHALL identify the detected version, explain that some CLI-dependent features may not work, and suggest the upgrade command. Users SHALL be able to dismiss the notification permanently via the standard "Don't show again" affordance.

#### Scenario: Old CLI detected at project open
- **WHEN** an OpenSpec project is opened, CLI detection succeeds with a version string older than `1.3.0` (e.g., `1.0.0`, `1.1.5`, `1.2.99`)
- **THEN** the plugin SHALL show a notification with title "OpenSpec CLI is older than 1.3.0" and a body including the detected version and the command `npm i -g @fission-ai/openspec@latest`

#### Scenario: Supported CLI detected at project open
- **WHEN** an OpenSpec project is opened and CLI detection succeeds with a version `1.3.0` or newer
- **THEN** the plugin SHALL NOT show the floor notification

#### Scenario: No CLI detected at project open
- **WHEN** an OpenSpec project is opened and CLI detection finds no CLI
- **THEN** the plugin SHALL fall back to the existing CLI-missing notification path (no floor notification — the user has no CLI to upgrade)

#### Scenario: Notification fires once per project open, not per tool window activation
- **WHEN** the floor notification has already fired during the current project session and the user opens/closes the OpenSpec tool window multiple times
- **THEN** the plugin SHALL NOT re-fire the floor notification — the per-project-open `StartupDetection` hook is the sole trigger

### Requirement: Config profile management

The plugin SHALL allow viewing and switching OpenSpec config profiles (core, expanded, custom) from the Settings panel.

#### Scenario: Profile display
- **WHEN** the user opens OpenSpec Settings
- **THEN** the current profile and active workflows SHALL be displayed

#### Scenario: Profile switch
- **WHEN** the user selects a different profile
- **THEN** the plugin SHALL update the global OpenSpec config and refresh available workflows

### Requirement: CLI update command

The plugin SHALL provide an "Update OpenSpec" action that runs `openspec update` to refresh agent instruction files.

#### Scenario: Update trigger
- **WHEN** the user triggers "Update OpenSpec"
- **THEN** the plugin SHALL run `openspec update` and display the result in the console

#### Scenario: CLI not available
- **WHEN** the CLI is not detected
- **THEN** the action SHALL be disabled with a tooltip explaining that the CLI is required

### Requirement: ComplianceService registration

The plugin SHALL register `ComplianceService` as a project-level service (`@Service(Service.Level.PROJECT)`) in `plugin.xml`. The service SHALL be injectable via `project.getService(ComplianceService.class)` and SHALL compose `BuiltInValidator`, `VerificationService`, and `SpecSyncService` to compute compliance results.

#### Scenario: Service registration
- **WHEN** the plugin starts for a project
- **THEN** `ComplianceService` SHALL be available via `project.getService(ComplianceService.class)`

#### Scenario: Service composes existing services
- **WHEN** `ComplianceService.checkCompliance(change)` is called
- **THEN** it SHALL delegate to `BuiltInValidator` for validation, `VerificationService` for artifact completeness, and `SpecSyncService` for delta spec readiness

### Requirement: CLI execution threading compliance

CLI commands executed via `CliRunner` and `CliDetectionService` SHALL use `Process` directly (via `GeneralCommandLine.createProcess()`) instead of `OSProcessHandler`. This SHALL allow CLI execution under any threading context, including ReadAction.

#### Scenario: CLI execution under ReadAction
- **WHEN** a CLI command is executed from a code path running under ReadAction (e.g., action update cycle)
- **THEN** the execution SHALL complete without throwing a threading violation

#### Scenario: CLI stream draining prevents deadlock
- **WHEN** `CliRunner` executes a CLI command that produces output on both stdout and stderr
- **THEN** both streams SHALL be drained concurrently to prevent buffer deadlock

#### Scenario: CLI detection stream handling
- **WHEN** `CliDetectionService` runs detection commands (version check, which, PATH resolution)
- **THEN** stdout SHALL be fully read before waiting for process exit

### Requirement: Cross-platform CLI detection

`CliDetectionService` SHALL detect the OpenSpec CLI on Windows under the same scenarios that succeed on macOS and Linux. On Windows the service SHALL extend bare candidate paths through `.cmd`, `.bat`, and `.exe` suffixes when direct invocation fails, SHALL resolve the executable via `where.exe` instead of a POSIX login shell, and SHALL probe Windows-specific install locations derived from `%APPDATA%` and `%LOCALAPPDATA%`. The macOS and Linux detection paths SHALL remain unchanged.

#### Scenario: Windows bare-name resolution falls back through executable suffixes
- **WHEN** the host OS is Windows and `tryPath("openspec")` is called and bare invocation fails
- **THEN** the service SHALL retry the candidate with `.cmd`, `.bat`, and `.exe` suffixes in that order, accepting the first variant whose `--version` invocation exits 0

#### Scenario: Windows extension fallback only applies when no extension is present
- **WHEN** the host OS is Windows and the candidate path already ends in `.cmd`, `.bat`, or `.exe`
- **THEN** the service SHALL invoke that exact path without appending further suffixes

#### Scenario: Windows shell PATH is resolved via where.exe
- **WHEN** the host OS is Windows and the bare-name and settings-path branches have not produced a hit
- **THEN** the service SHALL invoke `where.exe openspec` (not `/bin/zsh -lc`) and use the first non-empty stdout line as the next candidate path

#### Scenario: Windows common npm paths are probed
- **WHEN** the host OS is Windows and prior detection branches have not produced a hit
- **THEN** the service SHALL try, in order, `%APPDATA%\npm\openspec.cmd`, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\npm\openspec.cmd`, and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WinGet\Links\openspec.cmd`, skipping any candidate whose environment variable is unset

#### Scenario: User-supplied path with extension works as-is
- **WHEN** the host OS is Windows and the user has set the Settings CLI path to a path ending in `.cmd`, `.bat`, or `.exe`
- **THEN** the service SHALL invoke that path verbatim and SHALL NOT attempt suffix variants

#### Scenario: User-supplied bare path is extended on Windows
- **WHEN** the host OS is Windows and the user has set the Settings CLI path to a value with no extension
- **THEN** the service SHALL apply the same `.cmd` / `.bat` / `.exe` fallback as for auto-detected bare names

#### Scenario: macOS and Linux behavior unchanged
- **WHEN** the host OS is macOS or Linux
- **THEN** detection SHALL execute the existing branches (bare name → `/bin/zsh -lc which openspec` → `/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, `/usr/bin`) without invoking any Windows-specific code path

#### Scenario: Windows detection completes within the existing timeout
- **WHEN** detection runs on Windows and traverses the suffix-fallback, `where.exe`, and common-paths branches
- **THEN** the total wall-clock time SHALL be bounded by the existing `TIMEOUT_MS` budget per `runAndCapture` invocation, with no additional global wait introduced

### Requirement: Cross-thread field visibility

Fields in UI components that are written on background threads and read on the EDT (or vice versa) SHALL be declared `volatile` to ensure cross-thread visibility under the Java Memory Model.

#### Scenario: WorkflowActionPanel field visibility
- **WHEN** a pooled thread updates `activeChangeName`, `nextArtifactId`, `lastPrompt`, `lastOutputPath`, or `hasDeltaSpecs`
- **THEN** the updated value SHALL be visible to the EDT on its next read without requiring explicit synchronization

#### Scenario: UI state captured on EDT before dispatch
- **WHEN** a UI action dispatches work to a background thread that depends on Swing component state
- **THEN** the component state SHALL be read on the EDT before the background dispatch

### Requirement: Supported CLI versions and capability preservation

The plugin SHALL declare the set of OpenSpec CLI versions it supports — currently the `1.3.x`, `1.4.x`, `1.5.x`, and `1.6.x` lines, with floor `1.3.0` — and SHALL treat the user-facing behavior it delivers **for each supported version** as a preserved contract. Preservation is **per version and bounded by what the client provides**: where the installed client of a supported version provides the underlying command, a capability the plugin offers for that version SHALL NOT be removed, disabled, or re-gated for that version without (a) a delta on the affected capability's spec, (b) an entry in the changelog, and (c) a test asserting the changed behavior. A change that alters a supported version's delivered capability set with `Modified Capabilities: None` for the affected capability SHALL be treated as a defect.

Because the client's own surface differs across versions, the plugin's delivered capability set MAY legitimately differ between supported versions. Offering a capability for one supported version and not another is **faithful mirroring, not a regression, when it tracks the client** — for example, the `workspace` / `context-store` / `initiative` commands exist in `[1.4.0, 1.5.0)` and were removed by the client in `1.5.0`, so the plugin offers the 1.4 coordination write actions for `1.4.x` and correctly retires them for `1.5.x`. Such version-scoped, self-retiring differences are permitted, but adding, removing, or re-gating any version's capability is still governed by the delta + changelog + test rule above and SHALL NOT happen silently.

#### Scenario: A supported version's client-backed capability is not silently dropped
- **WHEN** a change would remove, disable, or re-gate a user-facing capability that the plugin currently delivers for a supported CLI version whose client still provides the underlying command
- **THEN** the change SHALL include a delta on that capability's spec, a changelog entry, and a test asserting the new behavior, and absent any of these it SHALL be treated as a defect

#### Scenario: The 1.6.x line is a supported generation
- **WHEN** the detected CLI is in the `1.6.x` line
- **THEN** the plugin SHALL deliver the full capability set it delivers for `1.5.x` (no re-gating), applying the 1.6-generation semantics specified by the affected capabilities (store health, registration outcomes, validator behavior), and per-generation contract coverage SHALL exist for the behaviors that differ
