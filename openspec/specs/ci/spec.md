# CI Pipeline

## Purpose
Continuous integration for build, test, plugin verification, signing, and release publishing — ensuring every change is compilable, tested, and compatible across supported IDE versions, and that releases are signed and published exclusively through CI.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Dual-job pipeline

The CI pipeline SHALL run two parallel jobs on every push to main and on every pull request targeting main: a **build** job (compile, test, and optionally sign) and a **verify** job (Plugin Verifier compatibility checks). The jobs SHALL have no dependency on each other and SHALL run concurrently.

#### Scenario: PR triggers both jobs
- **WHEN** a pull request targets main
- **THEN** the pipeline SHALL start both the build and verify jobs in parallel

#### Scenario: Push to main triggers both jobs
- **WHEN** code is pushed to main
- **THEN** the pipeline SHALL start both the build and verify jobs in parallel

### Requirement: Build job

The build job SHALL compile the project, run the full test suite, and upload test results as a build artifact. On the main branch, the build job SHALL additionally sign the plugin and upload the signed artifact.

#### Scenario: Build and test
- **WHEN** the build job runs
- **THEN** it SHALL execute `gradle build`, run all tests, and upload test results regardless of pass or fail

#### Scenario: Signing on main
- **WHEN** the build job runs on the main branch
- **THEN** it SHALL execute `gradle signPlugin` and `gradle verifyPluginSignature` using signing credentials from repository secrets

#### Scenario: Signing skipped on PR
- **WHEN** the build job runs on a pull request branch
- **THEN** the signing and signature verification steps SHALL be skipped

### Requirement: Plugin Verifier compatibility

The verify job SHALL run the IntelliJ Plugin Verifier against all IDE versions in the declared compatibility range, reporting binary compatibility, deprecated API usage, and experimental API usage.

#### Scenario: All declared versions checked
- **WHEN** the verify job runs
- **THEN** it SHALL verify the plugin against every IDE version from the minimum declared version (2024.2) through the latest available release

#### Scenario: Compatible result
- **WHEN** the Plugin Verifier reports "Compatible" for all checked versions
- **THEN** the verify job SHALL pass

#### Scenario: Incompatible result
- **WHEN** the Plugin Verifier reports binary incompatibilities for any checked version
- **THEN** the verify job SHALL fail, blocking the PR from merging

### Requirement: Dependency caching

The pipeline SHALL cache Gradle dependencies between runs using a cache key derived from the build file and wrapper properties, reducing build times for cache-hit runs.

#### Scenario: Cache hit
- **WHEN** the build files have not changed since the last run
- **THEN** the pipeline SHALL restore cached Gradle dependencies and skip downloading them

#### Scenario: Cache miss
- **WHEN** the build files have changed
- **THEN** the pipeline SHALL download dependencies and store them in the cache for subsequent runs

### Requirement: Runner environment

The pipeline SHALL run on a `java-21` runner with JDK 21, Gradle 9, and git pre-installed. The Gradle daemon SHALL be disabled for ephemeral container environments.

#### Scenario: No tool downloads
- **WHEN** the CI build runs
- **THEN** no JDK, Gradle, or Node downloads SHALL occur — all tools SHALL be pre-installed in the runner image

#### Scenario: Gradle daemon disabled
- **WHEN** the pipeline executes Gradle commands
- **THEN** the Gradle daemon SHALL be disabled via `-Dorg.gradle.daemon=false`

### Requirement: Release pipeline

The release pipeline SHALL be the exclusive mechanism for signing and publishing the plugin to JetBrains Marketplace. It SHALL trigger automatically when a `v*` tag is pushed, and SHALL build, sign, publish, and create a GitHub Release in a single workflow run. The build step SHALL fail if `CHANGELOG.md` does not contain an entry matching the tagged version, preventing publication with stale or missing release notes.

#### Scenario: Tag triggers release
- **WHEN** a tag matching `v*` is pushed to the repository
- **THEN** the release pipeline SHALL start automatically

#### Scenario: Build and test before publish
- **WHEN** the release pipeline runs
- **THEN** it SHALL execute `gradle build` (compile and test) before attempting to sign or publish

#### Scenario: Missing changelog entry blocks release
- **WHEN** the release pipeline runs and `CHANGELOG.md` has no entry matching the tagged version
- **THEN** the build SHALL fail before signing or publishing, preventing stale release notes on the Marketplace

#### Scenario: Plugin signing
- **WHEN** the release pipeline runs
- **THEN** it SHALL sign the plugin using `PLUGIN_SIGNING_KEY`, `PLUGIN_SIGNING_CERTIFICATE`, and `PLUGIN_SIGNING_KEY_PASSWORD` from repository secrets

#### Scenario: Marketplace publishing
- **WHEN** the plugin is signed successfully
- **THEN** the pipeline SHALL publish the signed plugin to JetBrains Marketplace using the `JETBRAINS_MARKETPLACE_TOKEN` secret

#### Scenario: GitHub Release creation
- **WHEN** the plugin is published to the Marketplace
- **THEN** the pipeline SHALL create a GitHub Release for the tag, attaching the signed plugin zip and including release notes

### Requirement: Local publish prohibition

The `signPlugin` and `publishPlugin` Gradle tasks SHALL only be executed in CI. Running these tasks locally risks uploading unsigned artifacts that block the CI release pipeline, since the Marketplace rejects duplicate version uploads.

#### Scenario: Local build permitted
- **WHEN** a developer runs `gradle build` or `gradle test` locally
- **THEN** the build SHALL succeed without requiring signing credentials

#### Scenario: Local signPlugin prohibited
- **WHEN** a developer attempts to run `gradle signPlugin` locally
- **THEN** the task SHALL be skipped due to missing signing environment variables, and the developer SHALL NOT work around this by providing local credentials

#### Scenario: Local publishPlugin prohibited
- **WHEN** a developer or automated tool runs `gradle publishPlugin` locally
- **THEN** the unsigned artifact SHALL conflict with the CI-signed release, blocking the official publish pipeline

### Requirement: Concurrency cancellation for in-flight runs

The CI pipeline SHALL declare a top-level `concurrency:` block in every workflow file to bound runner waste from rapid successive pushes. The block's policy SHALL differ between build/verify workflows (cancel-in-progress) and release workflows (serialize-without-cancel) to reflect their different operational invariants.

#### Scenario: Build workflow cancels in-flight run on new push to same ref
- **WHEN** a commit is pushed to a branch (or a pull request's source branch) that already has a build run in progress
- **THEN** the in-flight build run for that ref SHALL be cancelled, and the new run SHALL start immediately

#### Scenario: Build workflow concurrency is scoped per workflow + ref
- **WHEN** two different workflow files are both triggered by pushes to the same ref (e.g., a hypothetical lint workflow and the build workflow)
- **THEN** they SHALL NOT cancel each other — the concurrency group key SHALL include both the workflow name and the ref

#### Scenario: Release workflow serializes, does not cancel
- **WHEN** a `v*` tag is pushed while a previous release workflow run is still in progress
- **THEN** the new release run SHALL queue behind the in-flight run, NOT cancel it — concurrent `publishPlugin` invocations against the JetBrains Marketplace API are unsafe

#### Scenario: Release concurrency group is workflow-scoped, not ref-scoped
- **WHEN** the release workflow's concurrency group is declared
- **THEN** the group key SHALL be derived from the workflow identity (not the ref or tag name) so all release runs share a single serialization queue regardless of which tag they correspond to

### Requirement: Test coverage regression floor

The build SHALL enforce a JaCoCo coverage regression floor, wired into `check` so it runs in CI. The floor SHALL cover at least the **instruction**, **line**, and **branch** counters, and each minimum SHALL be set just below the recorded coverage baseline so that a change reducing coverage below the floor fails the build. The coverage baseline SHALL be recorded (measured value and date) alongside the floor. The floor SHALL be ratcheted **upward** as coverage improves and SHALL NOT be lowered without a recorded justification.

#### Scenario: Regression below the floor fails the build
- **WHEN** a change reduces measured coverage for a governed counter below its configured minimum
- **THEN** `jacocoTestCoverageVerification` SHALL fail, and because it is wired into `check`, `./gradlew build` (and CI) SHALL fail

#### Scenario: Branch coverage is governed
- **WHEN** the coverage floor is evaluated
- **THEN** it SHALL include a branch-coverage minimum in addition to instruction and line

#### Scenario: The floor is not silently lowered
- **WHEN** a change lowers a coverage minimum
- **THEN** the change SHALL record a justification; lowering a floor to make an unrelated change pass is not permitted

### Requirement: Testable functionality is unit-tested

Functionality that can be exercised without the running IDE platform — parsers, resolvers, version comparisons, action-gating logic, path/format handling, and similar pure logic — SHALL have unit tests that assert real behavior, such that each test fails if the behavior it covers is broken. A change that adds or materially alters such functionality SHALL add or update the corresponding tests in the same change. Tests that parse output the plugin does not control SHALL be contract-tested against captured real output rather than hand-authored shapes.

Contract fixtures SHALL follow a per-generation lifecycle: new captures SHALL be organized under CLI-version-named directories (`src/test/resources/fixtures/cli/<version>/`), and fixture provenance — the capturing CLI version or best-evidence era, the capture recipe, and whether the fixture is recapturable — SHALL be recorded in a committed manifest. Fixtures covering a still-supported CLI generation SHALL be retained with their assertions intact (not re-pointed at a newer generation's captures or deleted) until that generation's support is dropped by a spec-level change. A fixture whose source command no longer exists in the current CLI SHALL be documented as pinned in the manifest and in its consuming test rather than left to stale silently.

#### Scenario: New testable logic ships with tests
- **WHEN** a change adds functionality that can be unit-tested without the IDE platform
- **THEN** the change SHALL include unit tests asserting that functionality's real behavior, and each SHALL fail if the covered behavior regresses

#### Scenario: External-output parsers are contract-tested
- **WHEN** code parses output from an external tool (a CLI `--json`, an on-disk format, an API response)
- **THEN** its tests SHALL run against captured real output committed as a fixture, not against a hand-authored approximation

#### Scenario: New-generation captures are added without weakening legacy coverage
- **WHEN** contract fixtures are captured from a newer CLI generation whose output semantics differ from an already-covered, still-supported generation
- **THEN** the new captures SHALL land under the new generation's version-named directory with their own generation-specific tests, and the existing generation's fixtures and assertions SHALL be preserved verbatim

#### Scenario: Unrecapturable fixtures are pinned, not staled
- **WHEN** the current CLI no longer provides the command a committed fixture was captured from
- **THEN** the fixture SHALL be marked as pinned in the provenance manifest and its consuming test's documentation, and SHALL remain the coverage for the generation that provided the command

#### Scenario: Forgejo workflow honors the same concurrency contract
- **WHEN** the `.forgejo/workflows/build.yaml` workflow is triggered
- **THEN** it SHALL declare the same concurrency block as the GitHub `build.yml` workflow (group keyed by workflow + ref, cancel-in-progress true) so Forgejo Actions exhibits identical cancellation behavior

### Requirement: Single-sourced top-supported CLI version

The top-supported OpenSpec CLI version SHALL be declared in exactly one place in the repository (the `openspecTargetVersion` property in `gradle.properties`), and every other build or CI consumer of that version SHALL derive it from that single source rather than restating it as an independently-maintained literal. The build SHALL enforce, wired into `check`, that a captured contract-fixture corpus exists for the single-sourced version, so that advancing the target without capturing that generation's fixtures fails the build. The UI-smoke workflow's OpenSpec CLI installation SHALL name the single-sourced version, so the smoke suite cannot drift behind the declared support set.

This does not replace the durable version **floor** (the set of historical generations whose captured corpora must be retained, enforced by the cross-generation parity guard): the floor is a lower bound on retained coverage and is a distinct concept from the single "current target". The two SHALL remain separate.

#### Scenario: Target version without a fixture corpus fails the build

- **WHEN** `openspecTargetVersion` names a version for which no captured fixture corpus (`src/test/resources/fixtures/cli/<version>/`, with a `version.txt` whose content is that version) exists
- **THEN** the `check`-wired verification SHALL fail, and because it is wired into `check`, `./gradlew build` (and CI) SHALL fail

#### Scenario: Target version with a fixture corpus passes

- **WHEN** `openspecTargetVersion` names a version whose captured fixture corpus is present and whose `version.txt` matches
- **THEN** the verification SHALL pass without touching any other build output

#### Scenario: UI-smoke workflow installs the single-sourced version

- **WHEN** the UI-smoke workflow installs the OpenSpec CLI before running the smoke journeys
- **THEN** it SHALL install the version named by `openspecTargetVersion` (read from `gradle.properties`), not a version literal maintained separately in the workflow file, so the smoke suite runs against the plugin's declared top-supported CLI

#### Scenario: The historical floor is not collapsed into the target

- **WHEN** the single-sourced target version advances to a newer generation
- **THEN** the durable version floor enforced by the cross-generation parity guard SHALL still require the previously-covered generations' corpora, so advancing the target SHALL NOT drop coverage of an older still-supported generation

### Requirement: Scheduled-for-removal API usage fails verification

The Plugin Verifier gate SHALL be configured so that usage of IntelliJ Platform API **scheduled for removal** (`@Deprecated(forRemoval = true)`) is a build failure, in addition to the binary-compatibility failures the verifier already fails on by default. This makes a call to a method the platform has announced it will delete unable to merge, since such a call becomes a runtime `NoSuchMethodError`-class incompatibility once the platform actually removes the method — and the plugin's compatibility range is open-ended (no upper bound), so it must remain callable on every future build.

Plain-deprecated API usage (`@Deprecated` without `forRemoval`) SHALL remain permitted (report-only), because a plain deprecation will not be removed without a further for-removal cycle, and a usage whose only non-deprecated replacement is unavailable at the plugin's compatibility floor cannot be fixed without raising the floor. Such usages SHALL be tracked for migration when the floor advances rather than blocked.

#### Scenario: Scheduled-for-removal usage fails the build

- **WHEN** the plugin sources call an IntelliJ Platform API annotated `@Deprecated(forRemoval = true)` against any IDE in the verified range
- **THEN** `verifyPlugin` SHALL report it at a failing level, failing the build, so the usage cannot merge

#### Scenario: Plain-deprecated usage does not fail the build

- **WHEN** the plugin sources call an IntelliJ Platform API that is `@Deprecated` but not `forRemoval`, and no non-deprecated replacement exists at the plugin's compatibility floor
- **THEN** `verifyPlugin` SHALL report it without failing the build, and the usage SHALL be tracked for migration when the floor advances

#### Scenario: The default binary-compatibility failures are preserved

- **WHEN** the scheduled-for-removal gate is added to the verification step
- **THEN** the severity levels that fail the verifier by default (binary incompatibilities / compatibility problems, internal-API and override-only usage) SHALL still fail, so adding the scheduled-for-removal gate does not weaken existing verification coverage
