## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Project detection and initialization

The plugin SHALL detect OpenSpec projects by checking for `openspec/` and provide initialization via CLI delegation with built-in fallback. The built-in fallback SHALL honor the user's configured Default schema preference when writing `openspec/config.yaml`, falling back to `spec-driven` only when no preference is set. The built-in fallback SHALL write **only the fields upstream `openspec init` writes** — a `schema:` line and nothing else — and SHALL NOT write plugin-invented fields (`version:`, `profile:`) or empty upstream fields (`context: ""`, `rules: {}`) that upstream's Zod schema ignores. The plugin MAY still read `version:`/`profile:` from an existing (legacy) `config.yaml` for display, but SHALL NOT emit them into a config it generates.

#### Scenario: Project detection
- **WHEN** a project is opened in the IDE
- **THEN** the plugin SHALL check for `openspec/` directory and enable/disable features accordingly

#### Scenario: Init delegates to CLI when available
- **WHEN** `ScaffoldingService.initOpenSpec()` is called and the CLI is detected
- **THEN** it SHALL run `openspec init --tools <detected-tools>` and perform a synchronous VFS refresh

#### Scenario: Init falls back to built-in
- **WHEN** the CLI is unavailable or fails
- **THEN** the service SHALL create `openspec/config.yaml`, `specs/`, `changes/`, and `changes/archive/` via VFS

#### Scenario: Default schema honored on built-in init
- **WHEN** the user has set Default schema to a value other than empty (e.g., `workspace-planning`) in Settings → Tools → OpenSpec, and the built-in init path runs
- **THEN** the generated `openspec/config.yaml` SHALL contain `schema:` matching the user's chosen value, not the hardcoded literal `spec-driven`

#### Scenario: Default schema fallback when unset
- **WHEN** the user has not set Default schema (the setting is empty), and the built-in init path runs
- **THEN** the generated `openspec/config.yaml` SHALL contain `schema: spec-driven` (preserving the prior default behavior)

#### Scenario: Built-in init writes a schema-only config
- **WHEN** the built-in init path generates `openspec/config.yaml`
- **THEN** the file SHALL contain a `schema:` line and SHALL NOT contain a `version:` field, a `profile:` block, or empty `context:`/`rules:` entries — matching upstream `openspec init`, which writes only `schema:`

#### Scenario: Legacy config with plugin-invented fields still reads
- **WHEN** an existing `openspec/config.yaml` (from a prior plugin version) contains `version:` and/or `profile:`
- **THEN** the plugin SHALL still parse it and still surface those values in the tree view — only newly-scaffolded configs omit them
