## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Spec sync application

The plugin SHALL apply delta spec operations to main spec files under `openspec/specs/<capability>/spec.md` in a defined order matching upstream OpenSpec CLI: RENAMED, REMOVED, MODIFIED, then ADDED. Requirement-header matching SHALL treat the `### Requirement:` header token case-insensitively (matching OpenSpec CLI 1.4+ parsing), with requirement-name matching keeping its existing semantics; headers the service writes or rewrites SHALL use the canonical `### Requirement:` casing. File content SHALL be written via plain filesystem I/O on the calling thread. VFS refresh SHALL be performed within `WriteAction` on the EDT via `invokeLater` with a `CountDownLatch` to synchronize the background thread. The background thread SHALL wait on the latch before proceeding to post-merge validation. After applying all operations, the plugin SHALL run `BuiltInValidator.validateSpecFile()` on each affected main spec file and report any validation errors as warnings to the user. A MODIFIED operation whose target requirement name is not found in the main spec cannot be applied; the service SHALL treat this as an **always-on sync-safety guard** (rule `sync-modified-target-missing`) — surfaced in the sync preview (the decision point where the user approves the mutation) and skipping that operation — **independent of any setting**. This behavior SHALL NOT be gated on a persistent "strict" setting (that setting is removed); there is one honest behavior.

#### Scenario: Apply ADDED operation
- **WHEN** an ADDED operation targets a capability
- **THEN** the service SHALL append the requirement block to the main spec file, creating the file with a standard header if it does not exist

#### Scenario: Apply MODIFIED operation
- **WHEN** a MODIFIED operation targets a requirement name that exists in the main spec
- **THEN** the service SHALL replace the entire requirement block (from `### Requirement:` header through all scenarios) with the updated content

#### Scenario: Apply operation to a requirement with non-canonical header casing
- **WHEN** a MODIFIED, REMOVED, or RENAMED operation targets a requirement whose main-spec header is written with non-canonical casing of the header token (e.g. `### requirement: Name`)
- **THEN** the service SHALL locate and operate on that requirement block exactly as if the header used canonical casing, and any header it rewrites SHALL be emitted with canonical `### Requirement:` casing

#### Scenario: Apply MODIFIED with unmatched name is an always-on guard
- **WHEN** a MODIFIED operation targets a requirement name not found in the main spec
- **THEN** the service SHALL surface the `sync-modified-target-missing` guard in the sync preview (naming the requirement and capability, explaining the delta cannot be applied) and SHALL skip that operation — always, with no strict/lenient distinction and no dependency on any persistent setting

#### Scenario: Apply REMOVED operation
- **WHEN** a REMOVED operation targets a requirement name that exists in the main spec
- **THEN** the service SHALL remove the entire requirement block from the main spec

#### Scenario: Apply RENAMED operation
- **WHEN** a RENAMED operation has FROM and TO names
- **THEN** the service SHALL update the `### Requirement:` header text from the old name to the new name

#### Scenario: Apply to new capability
- **WHEN** an ADDED operation targets a capability with no existing main spec file
- **THEN** the service SHALL create `openspec/specs/<capability>/spec.md` with a purpose header and the added requirements

#### Scenario: Post-merge validation reports issues
- **WHEN** delta operations are applied and the merged main spec has validation errors
- **THEN** the service SHALL report the validation errors as warnings to the user via notification

#### Scenario: VFS refresh uses invokeLater with latch
- **WHEN** the service writes a spec file and needs VFS refresh
- **THEN** the VFS refresh SHALL be dispatched via `invokeLater` wrapping `WriteAction.run`, with a `CountDownLatch` that the background thread awaits before proceeding to validation

#### Scenario: Apply order matches upstream
- **WHEN** a delta contains a mix of RENAMED, REMOVED, MODIFIED, and ADDED operations targeting the same capability
- **THEN** the service SHALL apply them in the order RENAMED → REMOVED → MODIFIED → ADDED (mirroring `@fission-ai/openspec`'s `specs-apply.js` precedence), so that a RENAMED FROM-name collision with a REMOVED block is resolved by the rename happening first
