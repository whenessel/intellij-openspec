# Changelog

> **Maintenance: Living** — updated as part of every release (see the [documentation index](docs/README.md)).

## Unreleased

### Added

- **OpenRouter streaming and routing:** receive incremental text, configure downstream provider allowlists/order/fallback and data collection/ZDR requirements, inspect model limits and key status, and see the responding provider/model. Retries respect bounded Retry-After waits and cancellation; partial responses are never applied.
- **OpenRouter REST integration:** use an OpenRouter key stored in PasswordSafe, refresh the live text-model catalog or enter a model ID, and generate, explore or verify through the existing reviewed-context workflow. Provider switching keeps credentials and model preferences separate; canceled, blocked or incomplete responses are not applied.

- **OpenSpec CLI 1.12.x is now a supported line.** 1.12 is an additive, safe-direction superset of 1.11 — verified by running the real 1.12.0 CLI over the shared parity corpus, its default and strict validation verdicts are unchanged, so nothing is re-gated and the built-in validator needs no change. 1.12 adds one new, verdict-neutral diagnostic: when validating a change, an informational note now flags a delta whose target spec does not yet exist ("archive would refuse this delta"). It never affects the pass/fail verdict, and the plugin already surfaces it at the correct severity. The plugin declares 1.12.x supported (minimum CLI remains 1.3.0), with per-generation contract coverage against captured real 1.12.0 output including a positive-control lock on the new diagnostic.

### Fixed

- **Direct API: refreshed the built-in Gemini and Claude model lists to current identifiers.** The bundled Gemini models were `gemini-2.5-*`, which Google is retiring (2.5 Flash already deprecated), so a fresh Google AI Studio key failed with a model-not-found error on the first generation. Gemini now defaults to a current stable Flash model (`gemini-3.5-flash`) and the Claude list was refreshed to current dateless aliases; the Direct API output cap was also raised so large specs/designs don't truncate. The request contract, auth headers, and response parsing are unchanged. (OpenAI's list is unchanged this release, pending verification against its current models endpoint.)
- **Settings no longer freezes when you pick a Direct API provider, click Test, or save.** Storing and reading the API key from the OS credential store is a blocking operation (on macOS it can even wait on a Keychain prompt) and was running on the UI thread, so the Settings dialog and the Setup Wizard could briefly stall; "is a provider configured?" checks that gate the tool window ran the same blocking read. All of that now runs off the UI thread, so the interface stays responsive.
- **Cancelling a single artifact's generation now actually stops it.** The per-artifact Cancel is honored the moment the in-flight request returns: a cancelled generation writes no file and is no longer reported as a failed generation.
- **The OpenSpec tool window releases its resources when closed.** The console view, background timers, and file-change subscriptions are now torn down with the tool window instead of accumulating for the life of the project.

## v0.11.0

### Added

- **OpenSpec CLI 1.11.x is now a supported line.** 1.11 is an additive, safe-direction superset of 1.10 — verified by running the real 1.11.0 CLI over the shared parity corpus, its default and strict validation verdicts are unchanged, so nothing is re-gated and the built-in validator needs no change. 1.11 adds one new validation rule — a spec whose `## Purpose` is still a placeholder (a `TBD`/`TODO` marker, or the sentence archiving writes for a new capability) is now flagged with a warning (a failure under strict) — which only makes the CLI stricter, so the built-in fallback stays never more restrictive. The plugin declares 1.11.x supported (minimum CLI remains 1.3.0), with per-generation contract coverage against captured real 1.11.0 output including a positive-control lock on the new rule.

### Fixed

- **Generating `tasks` no longer fails on Windows** with an "Illegal char" error. Specifications are declared as a file glob (`specs/**/*.md`) rather than a single file; once the specs step was complete, assembling the next artifact's prompt tried to resolve that glob to a filesystem path, which Windows rejects (the `*` is an illegal path character), aborting generation. Non-Windows platforms accept `*` in a path and degraded silently, so the defect was Windows-only. The plugin now treats a glob-valued prerequisite as a reference on every platform, so generation succeeds identically across operating systems.
- **"Register Existing Store" no longer dead-ends on a healthy OpenSpec root that isn't yet a store.** Registering such a root requires confirming creation of its store-identity metadata; the action previously surfaced that confirmation as an un-actionable error dialog, leaving no way to proceed. It now shows a Yes/Cancel prompt (carrying the CLI's own message), registers the root on confirmation, and leaves it untouched on cancel. Roots that are already stores, and refusals, are unaffected.

## v0.10.0

### Added

- **OpenSpec CLI 1.10.x is now a supported line.** 1.10 is a strict additive superset of 1.9 — its validation engine is byte-identical to 1.9, and verified by running the real 1.10.0 CLI over the shared parity corpus, its default and strict validation verdicts are unchanged, so nothing is re-gated and the built-in validator needs no change. The plugin declares 1.10.x supported (minimum CLI remains 1.3.0), with per-generation contract coverage against captured real 1.10.0 output. 1.10's client-side additions — an `init --language` flag, a Zed editor target, and the first-run completion tip moved to stderr — are off-model or inert to the plugin. 1.10 is also the first two-digit minor version, so the plugin's version comparison is numeric and correctly orders 1.10.0 above 1.9.0.

## v0.9.0

### Added

- **OpenSpec CLI 1.9.x is now a supported line.** 1.9 is a strict additive superset of 1.8 — verified by running the real 1.9.0 CLI over the shared parity corpus, its default and strict validation verdicts are byte-identical to 1.8, so nothing is re-gated and the built-in validator needs no change. The plugin declares 1.9.x supported (minimum CLI remains 1.3.0), with per-generation contract coverage against captured real 1.9.0 output. 1.9's client-side additions — a new `validate --archived` flag and a task-numbering warning — make the CLI stricter, so the built-in fallback stays never more restrictive without changes.

## v0.8.0

### Added

- **OpenSpec CLI 1.8.x is now a supported line.** 1.8 support is additive over 1.5–1.7 — the store/workset coordination model and all coordination JSON shapes are unchanged, so nothing is re-gated. The plugin tolerates 1.8's new optional surfaces without complaint: the `.openspec.yaml` `retire_capabilities` key and the `config.yaml` `githubCopilot` block are ignored, and `status --json`'s new `isPlanningComplete` field is read alongside the retained `isComplete`. Verified against captured real 1.8.0 CLI output. The minimum supported CLI remains 1.3.0.
- **Built-in validation flags a requirement that has no body as an error on the missing `SHALL`/`MUST` keyword**, matching OpenSpec 1.8 (which still errors on a body-less requirement).
- **Built-in validation flags a spec that declares the same requirement name twice as an error**, matching OpenSpec 1.8's new main-spec duplicate-requirement check. When the OpenSpec CLI isn't installed, the built-in fallback previously stayed silent where the CLI reports an error; it now reports the duplicate (scoped to a main spec's requirements section, so change deltas that legitimately reuse a name across sections are unaffected).
- **Built-in validation flags a misplaced delta spec and a change with no deltas as errors**, matching the OpenSpec CLI's change-delta discovery. When the CLI isn't installed, the built-in fallback previously stayed silent where the CLI errors: a delta spec written directly at a change's `specs/` root — which the apply/archive merge silently drops — and a change that requires specs but has none are now reported. Delta discovery is also recursive now, so deltas nested under a multi-segment capability path are validated; changes that declare `skip_specs` stay valid.

### Changed

- **When the OpenSpec CLI isn't installed, built-in validation now treats a requirement that has a body but lacks `SHALL`/`MUST` as a warning rather than an error in default mode** — matching OpenSpec 1.8's own default behavior. Strict validation (Validate (Strict)) still counts it as a failure. This keeps the built-in fallback from being stricter than the CLI it stands in for; when the CLI is installed, its verdict is authoritative as before.

## v0.7.0

### Added

- **OpenSpec CLI 1.7.x is now a supported line.** 1.7 support is additive — the store/workset coordination model is unchanged from 1.5/1.6, so nothing is re-gated. The plugin recognizes 1.7's new optional surfaces without complaint: newer `.openspec.yaml` change-metadata keys (`skip_specs`, alongside `goal`/`affected_areas`/`initiative`) are read for display instead of raising a false parse-error; the new `config.yaml` keys (`operations`, `defaultStore`) are tolerated; and `status --json`'s additive per-artifact dependency edges parse cleanly (artifacts are keyed by id, so the accompanying schema-order reorder has no effect). Verified against captured real 1.7.0 CLI output. The minimum supported CLI remains 1.3.0.

### Changed

- **The tool-window tree is now focused on Changes.** The Browse tree shows the Changes section — your changes with per-artifact status — and no longer duplicates a spec/archive/config file tree: specs, archived changes, and `openspec/config.yaml` are browsed in the standard Project View (which already lists `openspec/**`) and open in the editor. A main spec opens in the editor with the platform's Markdown preview rather than the tool-window preview pane, which is now dedicated to change surfaces. Change nodes lead with the change **name** in the primary color, with the `X/Y` task count as dimmed secondary text — so the name no longer competes with its metadata, and a complete count is not colored as "done" (the status icon badge already tells that story).
- **Spec content search moved to Search Everywhere.** The always-on tree content filter is replaced by a Search Everywhere contributor: type a term that appears only inside a requirement's body or scenario text and it surfaces the matching requirement by name, opening its spec in the editor at that requirement. The search runs off the UI thread over your local OpenSpec files without building or persisting an index, so it also works during indexing.
- **One "Verify" surface for the pre-archive check.** The separate "Compliance / Pre-Flight" button and vocabulary are retired in favor of a single on-vocabulary **Verify** surface that renders three states: *ready to archive*, *in progress* (unfinished but valid — a neutral, bypassable state mirroring `openspec archive --yes`), and *blocked* (a validation failure — the only hard gate). "Verify" now means the same check from the tool-window button, the menu action, and the archive pre-flight; an unfinished-but-valid change is no longer over-stated as a red "archive blocked" error.
- **Change nodes no longer show an invented `[proposed]`/`[applied]` status tag.** OpenSpec has no change-status concept — a change is active or archived by its location — so the tag was plugin-invented. Change nodes now read name-first with just the dimmed `X/Y` task count, and a newly-scaffolded change's `.openspec.yaml` matches `openspec new change` exactly (the project's schema and a creation date, with no `status:` field). This also fixes a rare failure where archiving a change that had no (or a malformed) `.openspec.yaml` could half-succeed.
- **The tool window opens with more room for the Changes tree, and the preview pane's empty-state hint is clearer.** The Browse view now gives the tree the larger default share (the preview pane earns width when you select a change), so the pane no longer takes half the dock while empty. Its placeholder now reads "Select a change to see its consolidated deltas" — no longer naming the spec/requirement nodes the Changes-focused tree no longer contains.

### Fixed

- **Change metadata that uses newer OpenSpec keys no longer triggers a false parse-error warning.** A change whose `.openspec.yaml` carries newer optional keys — for example `goal` (written by `openspec new change --goal`), `affected_areas`, `initiative`, or `skip_specs` — was read with a strict parser, so any key the plugin did not model raised a spurious "`.openspec.yaml` parse error" warning on every change-list refresh and dropped the change's status/schema/created (it showed as `UNKNOWN`). The plugin now parses change metadata leniently — mirroring the OpenSpec CLI's own behavior of ignoring unrecognized keys — and reserves the warning for genuinely malformed YAML.
- **Config-validation no longer flags `config.yaml` states the OpenSpec CLI accepts.** The plugin no longer warns on a `version:` value (a plugin-internal field the CLI ignores), no longer nags for a `profile:` field (which belongs to the global workflow profile, not project config), and now treats a missing `schema:` as a quiet advisory rather than a warning (OpenSpec defaults it to `spec-driven`). A custom-forked schema (`openspec schema fork`) no longer falsely warns when the CLI isn't available to list it — schema-name recognition flags a name only when the CLI supplies the authoritative set, while a genuine typo still warns.
- **Regenerating an artifact no longer over-warns about unrelated artifacts.** The confirmation shown before regenerating a change artifact lists the already-complete artifacts a regeneration could make inconsistent. It now derives those from the OpenSpec CLI's own dependency edges (`openspec status --json` `requires`, CLI 1.7+) instead of inferring dependencies from the order artifacts appear in — so on CLI 1.7, which lists artifacts in schema order, it no longer names a sibling (such as `design`) that does not actually depend on the artifact being regenerated. Older CLIs, which don't report dependency edges, keep the previous list-order behavior unchanged.
- **The Settings schema list now shows the correct built-in status and artifact set.** The parser for `openspec schemas --json` read key names the CLI does not emit, so every listed schema was shown as non-built-in with an empty artifact set. It now reads the CLI's real fields (a `package` source marks a built-in schema; `project` marks a local fork), so built-in schemas are labeled correctly and each schema's artifacts are populated.
- **A strict Validate run without the OpenSpec CLI no longer fails a project the CLI accepts.** When the CLI is unavailable, the built-in fallback under **Validate (Strict)** was failing the verdict on the plugin's own advisory lint warnings — for example a change missing `design.md`/`tasks.md` — even though `openspec validate --strict` reports such a project valid. A strict fallback now flips the verdict only on a warning the CLI itself emits and fails on (none of the plugin's built-in warnings currently qualify), so the plugin is never more restrictive than the CLI it wraps in strict mode either.
- **The Settings → Config Profile section shows the active profile's workflows again.** It was built on `openspec config profile --json`, an option OpenSpec does not provide (the CLI rejects it), so the section always showed a blank fallback — no workflows, and a fabricated "description". It now sources the active profile name and its workflow list from `openspec config list --json` (the same data the status-bar profile widget uses), and the invented description is gone. Profile switching is unchanged.

## v0.6.0

### Changed

- **New projects get a cleaner `openspec/config.yaml`.** The plugin now scaffolds only the upstream `schema:` field — matching `openspec init` — and no longer writes the plugin-internal `version:`/`profile:` fields (or empty `context:`/`rules:`) that the OpenSpec CLI ignores. Existing configs are fully unaffected: a `config.yaml` that already carries `version:`/`profile:` still parses and still shows those values in the tree. Also fixes a stray `Version: null` line that could appear in the Explore AI context when a config had no `version:`.
- **Strict validation is now a per-run choice, not a persistent setting.** The always-on "Strict validation" checkbox in Settings is gone; instead, a new **Validate (Strict)** action — in the OpenSpec tool-window's Validate dropdown, the OpenSpec menu, and Find Action — runs a single strict validation on demand, mirroring the CLI's `openspec validate --strict` (warnings count as failures). This makes strict results reproducible and never a hidden mode: a strict run is disclosed in the summary (`Validate (strict)`, and `— strict: warnings count as failures` when it fails on warnings only) and echoes `--strict` in the console. Strict means the same thing whether or not the CLI is available. If you had the old setting enabled, a one-time notice points you to the new action. Separately, a change missing an optional artifact (`design.md`/`tasks.md`) is now always a plain warning, and a spec-sync that targets a missing requirement always surfaces a clear "can't be applied" guard in the sync preview.

### Fixed

- **Claude Direct API works out of the box.** The default Claude model was a non-existent identifier, so a freshly configured Claude Direct API key failed its first call with a model-not-found error; the Anthropic API version header was also set to an invalid value. The plugin now ships valid, current Claude model choices (dateless aliases that stay current) and sends the correct API version. OpenAI reasoning models (`o3`/`o4`/`gpt-5`, in addition to `o1`) now use the token parameter those models require. This only affects the optional Direct API path — nothing changes when generating via an installed AI CLI tool.
- **Validation no longer reports errors that `openspec validate` wouldn't.** When the OpenSpec CLI is available, a Validate run now defers to the CLI's own verdict for the specs and changes it checks — the plugin's built-in validator no longer overrides a clean CLI with its own stricter opinion, so a project that `openspec validate` reports valid is no longer marked failing in the IDE. Config checks (`openspec/config.yaml`) are now non-failing: because `openspec validate` never fails on config, a missing `schema:` is a warning (OpenSpec defaults it to `spec-driven`) rather than an error, and config validation never reds a project the CLI reports clean. When the CLI is unavailable, the built-in fallback validator matches the CLI's default-mode severities: a missing spec `# Title` and a scenario missing its `WHEN`/`THEN` clauses are reported as a warning and an info hint respectively (not errors), while a requirement with no scenario remains an error, matching the CLI.

## v0.5.0

### Added

- **Validation results now render grouped by file with clickable file:line links and per-severity coloring.** A Validate run no longer prints a flat, single-color block to the OpenSpec console. The report now opens with a verdict line naming the target (e.g. `Validation FAILED — Change \`x\``) and an error/warning/info count line, then groups issues under a per-file header — files containing an error first, then warning-only, then info-only, and within a file by line. Each issue's location renders as a clickable `file:line` link that opens the file at that line in the editor when the path resolves on disk; issues the CLI reports against a non-filesystem identifier degrade to plain, still-colored text rather than a dead link. ERROR, WARNING, and INFO each render in a distinct, theme-driven color, and a clean run shows a concise `✓ Validation PASSED` confirmation instead of an empty block. The improvement applies to every Validate surface (the toolbar and the Project-View scoped Validate); the summary notification is unchanged.
- **Validate from the Project View context menu, scoped to the clicked change or spec.** Right-click an `openspec/` file in the standard Project view and choose **Validate OpenSpec** to validate just that item in place: a file under `openspec/specs/<capability>/` validates that spec, a file under an active `openspec/changes/<name>/` validates that change, and a file under `openspec/changes/archive/`, the `openspec/` root, or `config.yaml` (or a selection spanning multiple items) falls back to validating the whole project. The menu item appears only when the selection is under `openspec/`. It reuses the same built-in-plus-CLI validation pipeline and reports to the same console as the tool-window Validate — no per-file valid/invalid verdict is invented.
- **Change-artifact status badges on the Browse tree.** A change artifact's status now shows as a small badge overlaid on the node's icon — done, ready, blocked, or not-created — instead of a Unicode glyph glued to the label; the label returns to the plain artifact id (with a subtle foreground tint kept as reinforcement, and a blocked artifact still naming its unmet dependencies as `(needs: …)`). The badges use distinct shapes, are theme- and HiDPI-correct, and each badged node names its status in its tooltip. A **change** node itself gains a done badge when all of its artifacts are complete (the change is apply-ready), and its label shows the change's task progress as an `X/Y` count when a tasks artifact exists. Only change, change-artifact, and missing-artifact nodes are badged — spec, requirement, delta-spec, and config nodes never are, since the OpenSpec model attaches no status to a spec. When the OpenSpec CLI is unavailable, badges degrade to done-versus-not-done rather than fabricating the ready/blocked distinction.
- **Consolidated change-deltas view.** Selecting a **change** in the Browse tree now renders a consolidated, read-only view of everything that change modifies at the spec level, instead of a blank pane. It shows a header and a one-line summary (capabilities touched and a count per operation), then groups the deltas by capability, then by operation — `ADDED` / `MODIFIED` / `REMOVED` / `RENAMED`, each badged as in a delta-spec preview — with each requirement's text and scenarios. The assembled delta set comes from the OpenSpec CLI (`openspec show`), never hand-assembled from files, and capability groups are shown in a stable order; a renamed requirement shows its from→to without a requirement body. Each capability section links to that capability's delta-vs-current-main diff, so the consolidated reading view and the per-capability diff complement each other. A change with no spec deltas shows an informative empty state, and when the CLI is unavailable the view shows a placeholder (individual delta-spec files still preview without it).
- **Searchable spec-and-change viewer with rendered preview.** The Browse tab is now a master/detail view: a read-only, theme-aware rendered-markdown preview pane sits beside the tree, so you can read a spec or change artifact without leaving the tool window. Single-click a node to render it; double-click still opens the real file in the editor. The preview renders per node type — a main capability spec, a change's proposal/design/tasks, or a change's delta spec — and a delta spec's `ADDED`/`MODIFIED`/`REMOVED`/`RENAMED` operation headers are badged so a change's proposed deltas read at a glance. Selecting a requirement scrolls the preview to that requirement's section. The pane is collapsible and its width is remembered. Search now reaches into content, too: the Browse search box matches requirement body and scenario text in addition to node labels, so you can find where something is specified, not just the requirement named for it — results still present as the filtered, auto-expanding tree. The viewer renders your own files and never synthesizes or scores spec content.

### Fixed

- **Spec tree and list counts now match `openspec show` / `openspec validate`.** The Browse tab's per-spec requirement and scenario counts are recovered by a line-oriented scanner that mirrors the OpenSpec CLI's own parser instead of fence-blind regexes, so the tree no longer disagrees with the CLI. Concretely: requirement headers, scenario headers, and normative keywords inside fenced code blocks (` ``` ` / `~~~`) are no longer counted as structure; **any** level-4 `####` header under a requirement is recognized as a scenario (not only a `#### Scenario:`-labelled one), while the bold `**Scenario:**` form is not; and a requirement's normative state is the whole-word `SHALL`/`MUST` read from its body (adding `MUST`, which was previously missed, and no longer treating `SHOULD`/`MAY` as normative). Existing specs may therefore show corrected counts — this brings the tree into agreement with the CLI. Parity is enforced against captured real CLI output.

## v0.4.0

### Added

- **Documentation maintenance framework.** Every doc now carries an explicit `Maintenance:` class (Living / Snapshot / Reference / Retired), a new [documentation index](docs/README.md) maps every doc with its purpose, audience, and class, and the [Version support](docs/openspec-support.md#version-support) block is the single source of truth other docs link to for version facts. A doc-hygiene test enforces that every doc is labeled and indexed.
- **Coordination write actions restored for the OpenSpec 1.4.x CLI line.** On an OpenSpec CLI in the `1.4.0`–`1.4.x` range, the Coordination tab again offers the create/set-up actions — **New Initiative**, **Set Up Context Store**, and **Set Up Workspace** — at its Full tier, delegating to the CLI and refreshing the listing on success. These shipped in earlier releases and were inadvertently dropped when the tab was rebuilt around the 1.5 store/workset model; this restores them. They are **version-gated and self-retiring**: OpenSpec CLI 1.5.0 removed the underlying `initiative` / `context-store` / `workspace` commands, so when you upgrade to a 1.5 CLI these actions disappear and the tab presents the stores/worksets model instead. Actions run off the UI thread and surface the CLI's error output on failure.
- **Read-only view of the OpenSpec 1.5 store and workset model in the Coordination tab.** OpenSpec CLI 1.5.0 introduced **stores** (standalone OpenSpec repos you register on your machine) and **worksets** (purely local, composed working views over them), replacing the earlier workspace/context-store/initiative model. When the detected CLI is 1.5.0 or later, the tab now lists your stores — each with its id, root, and health from `store doctor` (metadata present/valid, whether the root is a git repository, whether its OpenSpec root is healthy) — and your worksets with their member folders. Store diagnostics, including the CLI's ready-made fix suggestion, are shown as read-only guidance. Listings come from the OpenSpec CLI, with a built-in fallback that reads OpenSpec's global data directory directly when the CLI is unavailable. Any surviving pre-1.5 coordination state is shown, read-only, in a muted "Legacy (pre-1.5)" group. The plugin never migrates anything; it only reflects the state the CLI owns.
- **The schema authoring loop is now complete in Settings.** Custom workflow schemas could be forked and created from the IDE, but checking the result meant a terminal round-trip. The Schemas section now offers **Validate** — runs `openspec schema validate` on the selected schema and shows its findings (structure errors, missing templates, circular dependencies) inline below the list — and **Open Templates**, which resolves the schema's artifact templates via the CLI and opens them as ordinary editor tabs, giving schema authors a direct edit loop. Each schema in the list also carries a **resolution provenance tag** (`[project]`, `[user]`, `[package]`) sourced from `openspec schema which`, and a copy that shadows another source says so explicitly (e.g. `[project, shadows package]`) — so name shadowing is visible instead of surprising. All three actions delegate to the CLI, run off the UI thread, and follow the existing schema-management availability gate (OpenSpec CLI 1.3.0+; verified present on 1.3.x).
- **Store and workset write actions in the Coordination tab.** With OpenSpec CLI 1.5.0 or later, the tab's Full tier now delegates create/manage actions to the CLI: create a store (`store setup`, with a required folder location) or register an existing one, unregister it, or remove it (a guarded, destructive action that deletes the store's local folder); and create a workset from a chosen set of member folders, open a workset (revealing its member folders in your file manager, behind a confirmation), or remove a saved workset (member folders are left untouched). A `store doctor`-driven health strip surfaces the highest-severity diagnostic with its suggested `fix` as an inline action. Actions run off the UI thread and surface the CLI's own error/fix text on failure, never raw output.
- **Graceful legacy-file cleanup in the Update action.** The OpenSpec CLI's skills migration can leave `openspec update` reporting leftover files to remove while exiting 0 and suggesting `--force` or an interactive run — neither of which a non-interactive IDE console can provide, so the update looked successful but re-printed the same notice forever. The Update action now recognizes this outcome and offers a resolution instead of silent success: a review dialog lists every CLI-reported file with a checkbox and an open-to-inspect link, removal happens through the IDE as a single undoable step (covered by Local History and your VCS), and a follow-up `openspec update` verifies the result. When that verification shows the CLI *regenerating* the very files it flags — a real inconsistency in some CLI versions' tool integrations — the plugin explains that nothing on your side needs fixing and stops re-raising the notice until the CLI reports something different. You can also hand off to the terminal for the CLI's own interactive flow, or dismiss without being re-nagged while the pending file set is unchanged. The plugin never runs `openspec update --force` on your behalf.

### Changed

- **Built-in validation now matches OpenSpec CLI 1.6 verdicts.** The plugin's own validator (used by editor inspections and when the CLI is unavailable) now agrees with `openspec validate` on what passes: only `SHALL`/`MUST` satisfy the requirement-keyword rule (`SHOULD`/`MAY` never satisfied the CLI, so specs relying on them were passing the plugin while failing the CLI), keywords and `#### Scenario:` headers inside fenced code blocks no longer count (matching 1.6's fence-aware evaluation), and non-canonical level-3 headers inside a change's ADDED/MODIFIED delta sections get a new advisory-level hint — mirroring the CLI's 1.6 notice that such headers are skipped by validation — without ever affecting the pass/fail verdict. Verdict agreement is enforced by a contract test against captured real 1.6.0 CLI output. The plugin now formally supports the `1.3.x`–`1.6.x` CLI lines.

- **Store health follows OpenSpec CLI 1.6 semantics.** OpenSpec CLI 1.6.0 made a brand-new store legitimate before its planning directories exist: registering such a folder succeeds (1.5 refused it), and `store doctor` reports it healthy with the directories simply marked not-yet-present. The Coordination tab reflects this faithfully — store health is read solely from the CLI's own report, so a fresh, empty-but-healthy store lists cleanly with no error marker, on both CLI generations. The 1.6 register refusals (a folder whose `openspec/config.yaml` points at an external store, or an invalid `store:` declaration) and the new register identity-confirmation prompt surface the CLI's message and suggested fix verbatim, as all store actions do. Store/workset features continue to require CLI 1.5.0+; nothing changes for 1.5 users.
- **Verify's completeness check is now schema-aware, driven by the OpenSpec CLI.** The artifact-level completeness gate reads the change's own artifact set from `openspec status` — the same source the Apply gate uses — instead of checking a fixed `proposal.md`/`design.md`/`tasks.md` list against the filesystem. Verify and Apply can no longer disagree about whether a change is complete, and schemas whose artifact set differs from the classic three-file layout (for example a not-yet-written `specs` artifact) are reported correctly. Task-level granularity is unchanged: unchecked (`- [ ]`) and in-progress (`- [~]`) checkboxes in `tasks.md` still block archive with distinct counts. When the CLI is unavailable or below the supported floor, Verify falls back to the previous filesystem checks rather than failing.
- **Spec validation now matches the OpenSpec CLI 1.4 parser.** Requirement headers (`### Requirement:`) are recognized **case-insensitively** everywhere the plugin reads them — validation, editor inspections, the spec tree, and delta→main spec sync — matching how the CLI has parsed them since 1.4.0. Previously a spec the CLI accepted (e.g. `### requirement:`) could be flagged as missing requirements or silently left out of the tree. Sync continues to write headers in the canonical `### Requirement:` casing. In addition, a requirement whose RFC 2119 keyword appears only in its header line now gets the CLI's targeted guidance — *move the keyword onto the requirement body line* — as a dedicated diagnostic with an editor quick-fix, instead of a generic missing-keyword error.

- **Windows and macOS are now verified in CI alongside Linux.** The plugin's build and test suite runs on Windows and macOS hosts in addition to Linux, exercising platform-specific behavior Linux can't — Windows `%LOCALAPPDATA%\openspec` data-dir resolution and backslash/UNC path handling, the `.cmd` launcher shim invocation from paths containing spaces, and root canonicalization across symlinks (macOS/Linux) and 8.3 short paths (Windows). CRLF-vs-LF parse parity for the store and workset listings is checked on every platform. This hardens the store/workset read surface for Windows users in particular.
- **The Coordination tab stands down cleanly on OpenSpec CLI 1.5.0 and later.** CLI 1.5.0 removed the `workspace`, `context-store`, and `initiative` commands (replaced by a new store/workset model). The plugin now recognizes these as a 1.4-line-only capability: it invokes those commands only when the detected CLI is in the `[1.4.0, 1.5.0)` window, and on a 1.5.0+ CLI it no longer calls them or offers create/set-up actions that would fail — showing a read-only view when legacy on-disk coordination state exists, and hiding the tab otherwise. The built-in schema set is now `spec-driven` only, matching what a 1.5.0 CLI reports (the `workspace-planning` schema remains recognized on a 1.4.x CLI via its live schema list). The minimum supported CLI is unchanged at 1.3.0.

### Fixed

- **Explore mode honors your project's customized skill instructions again.** Since OpenSpec CLI 1.5 moved agent instructions to `.claude/skills/`, the Explore feature was still looking only in the old pre-1.5 locations — so on current projects it silently ignored any project-level customization of the explore skill and always used its built-in default. Explore now reads the current skills location first (including CLI 1.6's stamped skill files), with the old locations kept as fallbacks for pre-1.5 projects.
- **Validation results no longer drop errors on OpenSpec CLI 1.6.** CLI 1.6.0 reports some validation issues under bracketed paths (e.g. `requirements[0]`), which the plugin's previous output scanning misread — an affected error could vanish from the Validate results entirely. Validation JSON is now parsed structurally, so every error the CLI reports is shown, on every supported CLI generation.
- **The JetBrains Marketplace listing now shows the plugin's full description.** The listing had been displaying a one-line summary because the build was overwriting the rich description at packaging time. The description is now sourced from the README's overview section — one source of truth for GitHub and the Marketplace — and covers the current feature set: spec browser, change lifecycle, AI-tool handoff, schema authoring, and stores/worksets.

## v0.3.1

### Fixed

- **Coordination tab no longer silently drops to its offline view on the first OpenSpec CLI call in a fresh environment.** On its first run the OpenSpec CLI prints a one-time telemetry notice to standard output, ahead of the JSON that `--json` commands emit. That notice corrupted the plugin's JSON parsing, so the workspaces / context-stores / initiatives panel fell back to reading the global data directory instead of the live CLI result. The plugin now opts its own CLI invocations out of telemetry and tolerates any leading banner on CLI output, so the panel reflects live CLI state from the very first call.

## v0.3.0 — OpenSpec 1.4 Baseline

### ⚠️ Breaking

- **Minimum supported OpenSpec CLI is now 1.3.0.** Users on CLI 1.0, 1.1, or 1.2 will see a one-time startup notification recommending upgrade via `npm i -g @fission-ai/openspec@latest`. The plugin continues to function on its built-in fallback paths (project detection, init, spec browser, tool window) — but features that require the CLI (schema management, CLI-driven generation, agent instruction updates) gracefully degrade with the same "CLI not detected" UX the plugin already handles. To stay on a pre-1.3 CLI, pin to plugin v0.2.10.

### Added

- **Coordination tab for OpenSpec 1.4 workspaces, context stores, and initiatives.** A new tool-window tab surfaces the three coordination collections, sourced from the OpenSpec CLI (`workspace`/`context-store`/`initiative`) with a built-in fallback that reads OpenSpec's global data dir directly when the CLI is unavailable. The tab appears only when coordination state (or a coordination workflow mode) is detected, so spec-driven repo-local projects are unaffected. Initiatives show a lifecycle status badge (`exploring`/`active`/`complete`/`archived`); each initiative's artifacts (`initiative.yaml`, `requirements.md`, `design.md`, `decisions.md`, `questions.md`, `tasks.md`) open in the editor. With OpenSpec CLI 1.4+ the tab also offers create-initiative, set-up-context-store, and set-up-workspace actions; without it, the tab is read-only.
- **Detection for two AI tools introduced in OpenSpec CLI 1.4.0** — Kimi CLI (Moonshot AI) and Mistral Vibe. Supported tool count expands from 28 to 30.
- **Tailored delivery guidance** for both new tools. Kimi CLI and Mistral Vibe show terminal-style copy ("Paste into Kimi CLI", "Paste into Mistral Vibe") alongside Claude Code, Gemini, Codex, OpenCode, ForgeCode, and Bob Shell, and the IDE watches `tasks.md` for completion instead of prompting for manual save. The generic "Paste into your AI tool" fallback does not appear for these tools.
- **`workspace-planning` workflow schema is accepted as valid** under the V1_2 config baseline, matching its introduction upstream in OpenSpec CLI 1.4.0.
- **`RENAMED` delta sections are now fully supported** across validation, the inline delta-spec inspection, and the scaffolded delta template. `## RENAMED Requirements` blocks with `FROM:` / `TO:` pairs are recognized and validated, completing the four-section delta contract (ADDED, MODIFIED, REMOVED, RENAMED) and matching upstream OpenSpec. Spec sync applies operations in upstream order (RENAMED → REMOVED → MODIFIED → ADDED).

### Changed

- **Workflow-profile picker aligned with the CLI.** The profile combo in Settings now lists only CLI-accepted presets (the unsupported "custom" target was removed), surfaces the underlying cause when a CLI profile switch fails, and shows recovery guidance when a profile value carried over from an older plugin version is selected — with Apply disabled until you pick a supported preset.
- **Schema-name validation is driven off the CLI runtime.** Valid schema names are now the union of the plugin's built-in set and the live list from your installed CLI, and warnings report CLI status (available / unavailable / below floor) plus the recovery action.

### Fixed

- **Built-in project init now honors your Default schema setting.** Initializing a project without the CLI previously always wrote `schema: spec-driven` into `openspec/config.yaml`, ignoring the Default schema chosen in Settings (e.g. `workspace-planning`). The setting now flows through, falling back to `spec-driven` when unset.
- **Custom (forked) schemas no longer trigger a false validation warning.** A legitimate `openspec schema fork` name is now recognized instead of being flagged as unknown.
- **Config validation no longer flags a freshly initialized project.** The plugin previously emitted plugin-only errors and warnings (`config-missing`, `config-version-required`, `config-field-required`, `config-profile-recommended`) on an untouched `openspec/config.yaml` that upstream OpenSpec considers perfectly valid. Those rules were dropped; genuine upstream-aligned checks (schema required, schema/version recognized) remain.
- **`REMOVED` requirement validation no longer rejects valid delta specs.** The plugin reported a `REMOVED` requirement missing `**Reason**`/`**Migration**` as an ERROR, and its field check didn't recognize the `**Reason:**` (colon-inside) bold form — so delta specs the OpenSpec CLI accepts were flagged as invalid. This is now an advisory WARNING (the OpenSpec client validates `REMOVED` blocks by name and does not require these fields), and both the `**Reason:**` and `**Reason**:` formats are recognized.
- **Verify now counts in-progress (`[~]`) tasks.** The pre-archive completeness check previously counted only `- [ ]` and `- [x]` checkboxes, so a task marked in progress with `- [~]` was dropped from the count entirely — a change could report "ready to archive" while in-progress work remained. In-progress tasks now count toward the total and block archiving like unchecked tasks, and are reported distinctly (e.g. "2 task(s) not done (1 in progress)").
- **Settings "Version override" no longer lists values it can't apply.** The dropdown offered `1.3.0`/`1.4.0`, but the override targets the config-format version (a single baseline, independent of your installed CLI version), so selecting those had no effect. The dropdown now lists only applicable values; a custom value can still be typed.

### Removed

- **The Coverage tab and `@spec` gutter markers have been removed.** These surfaces relied on a plugin-specific `@spec <domain>:<requirement>` code annotation that is not part of OpenSpec — OpenSpec has no concept of annotating source code or scoring spec "coverage." Spec browsing and navigation remain in the Browse tab; for a per-change completeness check, use OpenSpec's own `verify-change` workflow, which requires no annotations and works in any language.

## v0.2.10 — Windows Support & OpenSpec 1.3 Tools

### Fixed

- **OpenSpec CLI is now auto-detected on Windows.** The plugin previously could not find `openspec.cmd` from npm or winget installs because Java's process launcher does not consult Windows `PATHEXT`. Detection now searches `%APPDATA%\npm`, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\npm`, and winget shim locations, and falls back through `.cmd` / `.bat` / `.exe` suffixes for any candidate path. The Settings panel and Setup Wizard surface a Windows-specific hint when a manual path is needed. macOS and Linux detection paths are unchanged. Fixes #11.

### Added

- **Detection for four AI tools introduced in OpenSpec CLI 1.3.0** — Junie (JetBrains), Lingma (Alibaba), ForgeCode, and Bob Shell. Supported tool count expands from 24 to 28.
- **Tailored delivery guidance** for each of the four new tools. ForgeCode and Bob Shell show terminal-style copy ("Paste into ForgeCode", "Paste into Bob Shell") alongside Claude Code, Gemini, Codex, and OpenCode. Junie and Lingma show panel-style copy ("Open Junie and paste the prompt", "Open Lingma chat and paste the prompt") alongside GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Cline, and Kiro. The generic "Paste into your AI tool" fallback no longer appears for these tools.
