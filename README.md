<!-- Plugin description -->
An IDE-native client for the [OpenSpec](https://github.com/fission-ai/openspec) spec-driven development framework by [Fission AI](https://github.com/fission-ai). Browse specs, orchestrate the propose → generate → implement → archive lifecycle, and route AI-generated artifacts through the tool of your choice — all without leaving your IDE.

**Features:**

- **Spec browser & viewer** — a master/detail tree of capabilities and requirements beside a rendered-markdown preview pane, with content-aware search (over requirement and scenario text), artifact-status badges on tree icons, and a consolidated change-deltas view that shows everything a change modifies at the spec level
- **Validation you can navigate** — real-time editor inspections and quick-fixes matching the OpenSpec CLI's own parser, plus a Validate action (from the toolbar or the Project View context menu, scoped to the clicked change or spec) whose results render grouped by file with clickable file:line links and per-severity coloring
- **Change lifecycle** — create, implement, verify, and archive OpenSpec changes from a dedicated tool window, with schema-aware completeness gates and task-level progress
- **Works with your AI tooling** — detects 30+ AI coding tools (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Gemini CLI, and more) and hands generation off to the one you already use, or calls the Anthropic, OpenAI, or Google APIs directly with your own key
- **Schema authoring** — fork, create, and validate custom workflow schemas, with template editing and resolution-provenance tags straight from the CLI
- **Stores & worksets** — browse and manage the OpenSpec CLI 1.5 coordination model, with health diagnostics and graceful support back to the 1.4 workspace model
- **Setup wizard** — guided onboarding for new and existing projects; the plugin works with or without the OpenSpec CLI installed and degrades gracefully

Compatible with IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, GoLand, WebStorm, RubyMine, and the rest of the JetBrains IDE family, 2024.2 and later. Spec browsing and validation are fully language-agnostic.

## Four Ways to Use It

| Persona | You are... | AI setup? | Get started |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Spec Browser** | A reviewer, lead, or PM who wants to browse specs | None | [Getting Started](docs/getting-started-browser.md) |
| **IDE-First Developer** | A dev using Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, or Cline inside IntelliJ | None (uses your existing tool) | [Getting Started](docs/getting-started-copilot.md) |
| **CLI Companion** | A dev using Claude Code, Gemini CLI, or another terminal AI | None (uses your existing tool) | [Getting Started](docs/getting-started-cli-companion.md) |
| **Standalone API User** | A dev with an API key who wants a fully self-contained workflow | API key only | [Getting Started](docs/getting-started-api.md) |

## Installation

Install from the [JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/30678-openspec) (search for **OpenSpec**), or build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/johnnyblabs/intellij-openspec.git
cd intellij-openspec
./gradlew build
# Install from: build/distributions/OpenSpec-*.zip
```

**Requirements:** IntelliJ IDEA 2024.2+ (Community or Ultimate), Java 21 JDK for building from source.

**OpenSpec CLI (optional):** The plugin works without the CLI via its built-in fallback paths, and AI-tool detection (all 30 supported tools) is plugin-side — it works on any CLI, or none. **Minimum supported CLI is 1.3.0** (see the canonical [Version support](docs/openspec-support.md#version-support) block for the full per-version support list). The plugin tracks the CLI's evolving model per version: on **1.4.x** it surfaces the legacy coordination layer (workspaces, context stores, and initiatives, plus the `workspace-planning` schema) that exists in the `[1.4.0, 1.5.0)` window; on **1.5.0+** it surfaces the current **store/workset** model that replaced it. On **1.6.x**, **1.7.x**, **1.8.x**, and **1.9.x** that coordination model is unchanged; **1.7.x**, **1.8.x**, and **1.9.x** support is additive — the plugin recognizes the CLI's new optional change-metadata (`skip_specs`, plus 1.8's `retire_capabilities`) and config fields (`operations`, `defaultStore`, plus 1.8's `githubCopilot`) and the additive `status --json` fields, all tolerated without new gates. **1.8** also relaxed one built-in check to stay in step with the CLI: when the CLI isn't installed, a requirement that has a body but no `SHALL`/`MUST` is a non-failing warning in default validation (strict still fails it), matching OpenSpec 1.8's default. **1.9** is a strict additive superset of 1.8 — its default and strict validation verdicts are byte-identical, so 1.9 support needed no built-in change. Note that **OpenSpec CLI 1.5.0 replaced the coordination commands and the `workspace-planning` schema with a store/workset model**; on 1.5.0+ the plugin stops calling the removed commands and instead shows the new model in the Coordination tab — your registered **stores** (with id, root, and health) and your local **worksets** (with their member folders), sourced from the CLI with a built-in fallback that reads OpenSpec's global data directory. Any surviving pre-1.5 state appears in a muted, read-only "Legacy (pre-1.5)" group. With CLI 1.5.0+ the IDE also offers store/workset **write actions** — creating or registering a store, revealing a workset's member folders, and creating or removing stores/worksets (store Remove is a guarded, destructive delete) — all delegating to the CLI; the plugin never migrates state — it only reflects what the CLI owns. The surface is language-agnostic and works across the JetBrains IDE family. Users on CLI 1.0, 1.1, or 1.2 will see a one-time startup notification recommending upgrade — the plugin continues to function but features that require the CLI are disabled:

```bash
npm i -g @fission-ai/openspec
```

**Windows note:** npm installs the launcher as `openspec.cmd` (not bare `openspec`). The plugin auto-detects it from `%APPDATA%\npm\` and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\npm\`, plus winget shims. If auto-detect misses your install, set the manual path in **Settings → Tools → OpenSpec → CLI Path** to the full `.cmd` location, e.g. `C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Roaming\npm\openspec.cmd`.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for development setup, coding standards, and PR process.

```bash
./gradlew build      # Compile and run tests
./gradlew runIde     # Launch sandboxed IDE with plugin
./gradlew test       # Tests only
```

CI verifies the plugin on **Windows and macOS in addition to Linux**, so platform-specific behavior — Windows data-dir resolution, backslash/UNC path handling, the `.cmd` launcher shim, and root canonicalization across symlinks and short paths — is exercised on a real host of each OS.
